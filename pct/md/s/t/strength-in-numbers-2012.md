Viewed at a distance, the world of mountain biking is a disjointed network of seemingly similar but disconnected communities. Freeride. Downhill. Big Mountain. All Mountain. Dirt Jump. Slopestyle. A sport of individuals, equally defined by their many differences, as the common threads that bind. And while our story doesn't follow a straight line, we all end up in the same place. Tire to ground, foot to pedal, hand to bar â€“ communities drawn together by trails of dirt.
