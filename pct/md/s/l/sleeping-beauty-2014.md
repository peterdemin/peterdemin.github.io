The beautiful Aurora is cursed into everlasting sleep by an evil witch for a crime she didn't commit. The brave Commander of the Guard, William, embarks on a quest inspired by both love and loyalty to free the doomed princess. He travels into the dark forest where he encounters a friendly elf that helps him on his quest, a dangerous wizard with no love for royalty or evil, a deadly assassin, and a ravenous creature that preys on human flesh before the final confrontation that will determine Aurora's fate.
