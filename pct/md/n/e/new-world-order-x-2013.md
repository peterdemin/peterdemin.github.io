In a dystopian future where pain and emotion have been suppressed by a government-issued drug called Torpase, Joshua Barrett coasts through the monotony of his repetitive, workaday life. But when he's kidnapped by a rebellious priest, Joshua is exposed to a world beyond Torpase, changing everything he thought he knew about what it means to live.
