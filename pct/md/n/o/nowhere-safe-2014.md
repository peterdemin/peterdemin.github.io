Nowhere to run...Nowhere to hide. After two teen girls cruelly impersonate her online in a reverse cyber bullying plot, Ashley s reputation is ruined. She and her mother, Julie (a high school teacher), are ostracized, forcing them to flee an escalating threat to their lives. Starting over in a new town and school, romantic interests and the poignant lessons from Kevin, an eccentric history teacher, draw them out of seclusion. However, when the past catches up with Ashley, she draws on what she s learned from Kevin s history lessons, giving her strength to stand tall rather than giving in to the bullies that torment her. With the support of her mother and new found friends, Ashley confronts her painful past, using the very tools of social media and technology that originally hurt her to expose lies and spread the truth.
