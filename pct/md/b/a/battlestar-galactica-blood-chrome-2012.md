The first Cylon war has been raging for 10 years and a young Ensign William Adama joins the fleet. He's disappointed not to be assigned to a fighter but to a freighter, and his co-pilot isn't too keen on having a rookie flying his aircraft as he has only a short time before he again becomes a civilian. Their cargo is a civilian scientist, Dr. Becca Kelly, but they no sooner leave than she has new orders for them and a new destination. Although sheâ€™s less than forthcoming about the details of her mission, Adama is keen, particularly as it involves going into Cylon controlled space. However, nothing is as it seems.
