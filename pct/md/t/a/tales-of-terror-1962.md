Three stories adapted from the work of Edgar Allen Poe:  1) A man and his daughter are reunited, but the blame for the death of his wife hangs over them, unresolved.  2) A derelict challenges the local wine-tasting champion to a competition, but finds the man's attention to his wife worthy of more dramatic action.  3) A man dying and in great pain agrees to be hypnotized at the moment of death, with unexpected consequences.
