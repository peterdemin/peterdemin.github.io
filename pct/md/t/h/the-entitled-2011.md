Without the security of the job he wants or the future he dreamed of, Paul Dynan plans the perfect crime to help his struggling family â€“ abduct the socialite children of three wealthy men and collect a ransom of $3-million dollars. Over the course of one long night, Paul and his accomplices hold the rich kids hostage awaiting the ransom with little idea of the secrets that will surface between the fathers when they are forced to choose between their children and their money.
