Throughout his upbringing, unnatural phenomena surround Leon. He is plagued with a terrible curse, over which he exercises no control. During the full moon he changes into a ferocious beast, initiating an orgy of indiscriminate killing. His love for Cristina enables Leon to suppress his lycanthropic feelings - until the engagement is broken off, which precipitates a tragic conclusion.
