Three college friends go to the biggest party of the year, each looking for something different: love, sex and a simple human connection. When a supernatural phenomenon disrupts the party, it lights a fuse on what will become the strangest night anyone has ever seen. As the three friends struggle to find what theyâ€™re looking for, the party quickly descends into a chaos that challenges if they can stay friends or if they can even stay alive.
