After a brutal injustice occurs on a Native American reservation, a son must find redemption for the actions of his past.  Road to Paloma is the beautiful journey of two bikers traveling across America's vast west. While Native American Wolf (Jason Momoa) is being pursued by the FBI for having taken the law into his own hands, when his mother was raped and killed on their reservation he crosses paths with Cash (Robert Mollohan), a down and out musician who is coping with the end of his marriage. An unlikely friendship develops, as they ride together towards the Teton mountain range, where Wolf will spread his mothers ashes.
