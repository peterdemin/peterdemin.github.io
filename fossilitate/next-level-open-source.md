# Filling the gap in open source supply chain

Upsides:

* Open source is the best way to move faster as a whole.
* Less reinventing the wheel.
* Free contributions.

Downsides:

* Part of the product is owned and maintained by someone outside of the company.
* Bug fixes are slower to get to the production, because of the release cycle.
* Feature requests may get no attention, or be rejected.
* Library may get completely abandoned.

Solution:

* Partner with open source library maintainers.
* Provide bounties to maintainers for working on issues needed by the clients.
* Maintain private artifactory for fork releases.
* Private releases a faster to incorporate new patches.
* Private releases with backported bug fixes.
