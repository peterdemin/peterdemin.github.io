# Solarized colors for Shibuya theme

[Shibuya](https://shibuya.lepture.com/) is the amazing Sphinx theme this website uses, and I like the colors that [Hsiaoming](https://lepture.com/) came up with.
But I put [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) on everything I can.
Here's how I do it:

`_static/custom.css`:
```{literalinclude} ../_static/custom.css
:language: python
```
