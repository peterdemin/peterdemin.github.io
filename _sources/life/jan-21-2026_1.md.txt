Exploring Radicle landed me on [Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org). I'm concerned with the eth- prefix in their domain name, and a mention of blockchain and web3 on the main page. But I like how they managed to build some community and ecosystem around this project. Fun fact: instead of regular documentation, they have [The Book of Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/the-book-of-swarm-2.pdf) of 272 pages. I wonder how much of it is AI slop, though.
On the note of automatic distribution of 4KB chunks through the network, I wonder how long before DMCA watchdogs start sending their letters to all owners of a chunk of a copyrighted content.
With IPFS and BitTorrent node owner at least controls what content to store and serve.
