Here's some food for thought.
We got some nice green seedless grapes from Costco, but they were super tart.
If you let unripe grapes sit on a dark shelf for a couple of days, they'll get sweeter.
But they won't get more callories, because of the laws of conservation.
The grape is sealed and its carbohydrates don't go anywhere.
But my mind tricks me into thinking that sweet food provides more energy.
