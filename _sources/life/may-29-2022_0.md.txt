we went to Rocky Gap State Park's campground for the Memorial Day. Met few nice folks, hiked a few miles, rented a canoe for a family ride on a lake, went star watching, had a lot of meat with beer.
Whether was great except for a short rain on the first day when we had to setup the camp. We built a short zip line from 3 truck straps, which was more fun during building than riding.
I’m still a bit confused by US style camps, which have too much convenience to my taste, that doesn’t let enjoy the nature to its fullest.
