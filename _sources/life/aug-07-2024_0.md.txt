I was watching [Expanse](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) and was fascinated by their handheld devices (phones?).
I liked the way they wirelessly cast screen using two-fingers swipe up in the direction of the cast target.
I also liked how they share message attachments.
The operating systems they are running seem to provide consistent experience across devices, so I assume there's a tight integration.
What I liked most is that attachments contained two kinds formats.
One was a presentation layer, similar to a static HTML page.
Another was data (like JSON, or CSV) that can be direcly imported to a database or Jupyter Notebook.
Like one time a person sent a bunch of people profiles, and the other side reviewed them and imported to their contacts.
Another time it was asteroid coordinates, that were presented as an interactive 3D model, but also could be imported into the navigational system.
I wonder if we can build this today.
Each attachment would be an archive with HTML file that pulls raw data from a JSON file sitting by its side.
But also having a "Download" button that exposes the data file directly.
Or maybe a single HTML file with all the small data and assets embedded, and large assets pulled from S3.
