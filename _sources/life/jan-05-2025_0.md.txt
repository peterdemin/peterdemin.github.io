When watching movies, or (some) people on the street I keep catching myself thinking, that there many things that cause a great deal of distress for people, but are absent in my life:

- War
- Violence
- Threats
- Serious health issues
- Drugs
- Crime and criminals
- Hatred
- Racism
- Discrimination
- Poverty
- Starvation
- Blackmail
- Guns
- Adultery
- Homelessness
- Serious mental issues

That's what allows me to engage in hobby projects, that don't address any immediate pressing need.
They are not without a challenge, but they bring me joy, and that's their sole purpose.
