I'm brewing these 3 ideas together:
1. [Johnny•Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system to organise projects.
2. Internal ENG documentation, like [PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/how-posthog-works) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/all-remote-vs-hybrid-remote-comparison/).
3. Async communications in distributed teams, promoted by [Zulip](https://zulip.com/).
