This is good: [The Collapse of Self-Worth in the Digital Age](https://thewalrus.ca/collapse-of-self-worth-in-the-digital-age/). The part that resonated with me most:
> when a person's innate value is replaced with exchange value, it is as if we've been reduced to "a mere jelly."
I remember the times where I put maximum effort and long hours over more than a year to achieve the next invidividual contributer level.
Eventually, with the project success, I got it.
My level became IC5, as opposed to the measly IC4.
Then I got some form of a depression.
Because my whole self-worth was reduced to number 5 by the authority, that I put most of my waking hours in.
