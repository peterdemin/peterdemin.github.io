One of the thoughts that I come back over and over again is how leetcode interviews are failing at letting good candidates pass.
Sometimes candidates are so anxious, that they can't put a for loop together. Even after building complex systems for a decade.
Nothing new, I guess. The prerequisite for passing a leetcode interview is being comfortable with leetcode interviews.
