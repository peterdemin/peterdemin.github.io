I keep catching myself at the thought of inevitable decline.
Am I at my peak? Or am I past it? Is it only downhill ahead?
I think I can't find a breaking point because there's so many aspects to be considered.
Like cognitive decline, that starts at twenty one, but is balanced out by growing pattern matching library.
The shrinking breadth of opportunities, countered by accumulated wealth.
