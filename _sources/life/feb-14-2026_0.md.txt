Today I learned that `.dev` top-level domain is [HSTS-preloaded](https://endtimes.dev/dev-and-hsts-preload/).
It means that `.dev` websites can only be accessed through HTTPS (not HTTP).
HTTPS is cool and everything, but there's a side effect.
Which comes from using VPN, and internal resources.

These days, I only consider Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.
Unfortunately, my DNS provider doesn't expose API access, which makes DNS-01 challenge automation impossible.
That leaves me with only HTTP-01 challenge, which means I need to have my host exposed to the public internet.
Which is not the case.

But hey, the resource is already accessed through a VPN, so it's encrypted in-transit the best way possible.
That makes HTTPS redundant.
Okay then, let's use plain HTTP, right?
Not if you're on `.dev` domain, you don't.
Thanks to HSTS, HTTP protocol is off-limit.
