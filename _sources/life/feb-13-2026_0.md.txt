The thought of tiny flowers in a winter garden didn't leave my head for some time,
so today I vibed a wrapper around [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library
(actually, a [port](https://github.com/giulianopz/go-readability)
by [Giuliano Panzironi](https://giulianopz.github.io)).
It fetches a page from a given URL, passes it through main content extraction and cleaning,
and presents in a distraction free layout using Solarized Dark theme.
Here's an example of what it looks like:
[https://reader.demin.dev/?url=https://peter.demin.dev/life/feb-05-2026_0.html](https://reader.demin.dev/?url=https://peter.demin.dev/life/feb-05-2026_0.html)
The evening I spent openining random pages in full-screen mode and enjoying distraction free content.
In the spirit of minimalism I made this service a socket-activated Go binary.
So it doesn't take any of the precious RAM on my tiny VPS when idle,
but also has a very small runtime footprint:
```
○ reader-api.service - Reader extractor API

```
Can it get more minimal than that? I don't think so.
