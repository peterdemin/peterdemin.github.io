I like the idea how software systems are complex and complicated.
Complex stands for inherent problem the software solves.
Complications come from solving the problem in a wrong way.
It could be using bad abstraction, over-engineering, inadequate team structure resulting in mixed component responsibilities.
Software is meant to solve the complexity of the real world problem, but it always introduces unnecessary complications for maintainers.
Complexity can't reduced, as it is inherent to the problem at hand, while complications constitute technical debt, that can and should be addressed but rarely is.
The same thinking can be applied to life in general.
The inherent conflict of life is that it's finite and energy consuming.
Besides that, most of the struggles we go through are artificial complications.
The worst examples of such struggles come up when complications take over complexity.
People get caught in the minutiae of everyday life, chasing synthetic goals, imposed by other people who have no interest in their wellbeing.
Governments create laws and procedures that are designed to prevent crime, but make everyones lifes harder.
Rich people find ways to suck money from poor.
Personal decisions must go through an approval of some external entity.
Social contracts prevent expression of internal desires.
