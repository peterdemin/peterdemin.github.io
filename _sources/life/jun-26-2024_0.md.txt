When you look at life back, you can tell the defining traits of your personality and the key decisions you made a long time back.
Sometimes they do feel like a big deal, and you know it's important right away.
Sometimes it's just minutae that doesn't seem of any significance in short term.
And sometimes we obsess a lot about something that we can't even remember five years down the road.
But never have I made a critical decision thinking how would I feel about it when I'm fifty.
Something about how the dots get connected once you look back.
