I want to experiment with hosting .deb (.rpm?) packages on GitHub pages.

So far, I found these two tutorials:
* https://assafmo.github.io/2019/05/02/ppa-repo-hosted-on-github.html
* https://pmateusz.github.io/linux/2017/06/30/linux-secure-apt-repository.html

Would be nice to automate the index update and GPG signing through GitHub Actions.

Packages, that I'm most interested in hosting:
* Kibitzr
* Arr family: Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr.
