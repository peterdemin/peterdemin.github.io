What if engineering strategy, performance reviews, and code quality metrics were connected?

- The engineering strategy spells out what engineering goals are.
- Performance review questions address those aspects directly.
- Continuous Integration measures and tracks the project metrics towards the goals.
- Self-review is just a biannual export from the CI.

Beautiful utopia.
