For *years* I had these lines in my `~/.vimrc`:

```
set background=dark
" set background=light
```

I would go and move the comment to the other line whenever I needed to switch to another mode.
Until today, I discovered this [jewel from Vinit Kumar](https://vinitkumar.me/current-vim-setup/):

```vim
function! ChangeBackground()
  if system("defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle") =~ '^Dark'
    set background=dark
  else
    set background=light
  endif
endfunction
call ChangeBackground()
```

It detects the current Appearance setting and picks the corresponding Solarized theme.

Thank you, Vinit! And thanks to [hnpwd](https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io) for connecting me with Vinit!
