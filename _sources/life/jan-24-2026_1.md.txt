Reading about radicle made me repeatedly question its purpose.
I liked how it uses PKI for identity, and made me think of a minimal implementation of a Web UI for issues and code review.
The idea is to host a forge as a static website.
Users would put their private key into the browser's local storage (so it never leaves the machine) and use it for signing messages.
The server would use SSH authorized keys for both accepting git pushes and issues/code review comments.
Messages would be stored as markdown files, and server would incrementally rebuild the HTML on submission.
The discussions could live in the same repo under a separate path or branch, or in a separate repo.
This way developers could interact through git by adding or changing the message files, or through the web interface.
