I get this feeling in the morning, that I need to make the last push and get it done.
And it's confusing, because there's no finish line.
No matter what gets done, the life goes on, and it packs more of the same.
Maybe it's a natural desire to accomplish something, to achieve a goal.
The problem is that there's no single goal, a lot of things happen in parallel.
Something starts, something finishes, and some things just die off.
Maybe I just need a vacation. Get rested. And keep running without this weird feeling.

The hypothetical situation of where you land in a position, where all the hard stuff is behind.
You can relax and just enjoy yourself.
