This is gold:

> [Rational ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the supposed cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the expected potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.

I've done it to so many topics, and had hard time explaining why exactly even to myself.
Religion, politics, Android development, serverless, etc.
So many things where I see the low value without having putting 1% effort into study.
Of course, there are things that I ignore out of laziness and arrogance as well. But that's off-topic.
