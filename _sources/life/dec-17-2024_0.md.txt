Coming back to [](/17_notes/28-karpman_drama_triangle.md),
I think how "Who is right" and "Who is wrong" are drama-ignited questions.
They don't serve a purpose of resolving a conflict, and creating a learning moment.
They fight fire with gasoline, ignited by drama, fueling more drama.
When a person's goal is to prove they're right, solution is out of the picture.
