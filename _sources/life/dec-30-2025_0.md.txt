I got bored enough to add an [RSS feed](https://peter.demin.dev/life.xml) to this journal.
Having a custom plain-text format for these records, I had to add a custom Atom generator.
Overall it was a smooth sailing, with two gotchas:

1. CommaFeed (at least) doesn't like escaped HTML inside content fields, even if `type="html"`.
   So I had to switch to CDATA encoding.
2. Python's builtin `xml.etree` library doesn't support CDATA ([CPython#81055](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81055) hanging from 2019).
3. So I switched to lxml that does.
   Turns out lxml.etree is slightly incompatible in managing namespaces.
   It took a bit of googling to find out, that instead of `ET.register_namespace('', 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom')`,
   I should do `ET.Element(..., nsmap={None: 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'})`.

So, business as usual.
