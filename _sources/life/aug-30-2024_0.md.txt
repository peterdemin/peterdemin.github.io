Crazy man market analysis (open).

1. What's going on with MSFT? Nothing they're OpenAI's bitch now.
2. NVDA dipped down, taking FSELX with it. The news show that they're going to come back strong soon.
3. PDD is bonkers, random off-market jumper.
4. Macy's stable, time to start stocking up (from MSFT, for example) for November.
