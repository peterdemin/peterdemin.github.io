I discovered a neat application for AI.
My wife asked me to look up a recipe online as she was cooking.
The problem with online recipies is that there's plenty, differing in minor ways.
They are most likely poorly formatted and riddled with ads.
ChatGPT to the rescue, here's my prompt:
> I need a complete recipe for Pavlova cake with weights in grams.
> I need it nicely formatted for printing on a single page.
> Make it an HTML page with printer-friendly styles.
Copy'n'Paste the HTML to a file, open it and send to printer.
