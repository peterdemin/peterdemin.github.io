Picture a person in a spacious room. His name is Herbert.
He's a scientist, and he studies and works all day long without any need to go out, make food, do laundry, or anything.
He has no distractions; he's fully focused on his work.
No Netflix, no games, no TV at all.
Yet, he has access to all the information he needs for work.
No people, except for brief visits of housekeeping.
A perfectly balanced diet, regular sleep schedule, no viruses, no disturbances.
