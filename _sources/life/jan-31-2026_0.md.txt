I was wondering through a community gargen, which is quite bleak this time of year.
I started noticing these tiny rare flowers scattered across.
The overall scarcity made them noticable and brought attention, that otherwise would be lost in the summer abundance.

In a way, I get the same effect in my RSS feed.
When I have 100 posts to go through, I skim and skip quickly.
But if I have just a few, I read them through.
Same goes for email digests, if they try to cover too much ground, the value of each item is lost in the overwhelming deluge of information.
