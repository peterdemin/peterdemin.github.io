Crazy man market analysis.

1. eBay gains popularity, as more people are willing to buy second-hand eletronics (read phones).
   When most of the tech stock went down in July, eBay kept growing.

2. Nvidia dipped a little bit on the overall growth trend.

3. What the hell is this PDD company? It tanked a lot. It's last year has been very volatile.

4. Just look at this MRM shit. Closed at $2.48, opened at $7.01. Daytrading my ass.
5. Macy's got a bad look from big guys and going down. Not all the way to the bottom just yet, let's take a look in 5 days.
