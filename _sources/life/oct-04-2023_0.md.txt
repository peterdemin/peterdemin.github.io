Turns out you can't use regular RJ45 connectors with flat ethernet cables because the wire diameter is much smaller.
And it's really hard to find the connectors for flat cables due to low supply.
It's like half the size of the regular round cable wire.
I had to learn it the hard way.
Lesson learned: when buying ethernet cable pay attention to the wire gauge.
AWG 24 is okay, but AWG 32 is too small.
