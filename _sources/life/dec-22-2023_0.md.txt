so, I have this idea, that I can’t articulate properly for years. It’s like with Ikea furniture, that seems bland and minimalistic. It doesn’t express any style or beauty, it’s functional and that’s it. Another example is people who focus their self expression in the way they look. Be it some special hair style, choice of clothes, or tattoos. Contrary to people who look bland, maybe simple. But express their selves in their thoughts. It feels like people who spend their time on their looks trade it for having something worthy in their heads. The parallel with the furniture is that you can make your prefab functional furniture truly yours and personal with DIY decoration, and you can spend good times wondering your mind, as opposed to going to hair stylist, or picking a tattoo that matches your personality.
I guess, what I’m trying to say is, your self expression is not for showing off someone else’s craft, it’s for you alone and small circle of people who matter to you.
