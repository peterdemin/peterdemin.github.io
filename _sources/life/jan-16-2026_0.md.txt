I got into this trap twice, so I guess I might not be alone.
I review someone else's code, and I get a strong feeling it was AI-generated.
Because no human could possibly produce this kind of well-documented, type-annotated mindless slop.
I feel offended for author being careless and pushing through slop without control.
I ask the author whether they reviewed the generated code themselves before pushing it.
They tell me they didn't use AI.
They wrote the code themselves.
