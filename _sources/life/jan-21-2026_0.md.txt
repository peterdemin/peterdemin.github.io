This looks like a trend, and I don't know how I feel about it:
- HN post "[Ask HN: Share your personal website](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618714)" got 947 points and 2382 comments. The repo received 100+ pull requests in 7 days.
- Its predecessor from 2023 "[Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618714)" got 1014 points and 1940 comments.
- The scrape of that post [started](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb/) - a random blog browser, powered by a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb).
- [RSS.Social](https://rss.social) - feed syndicator from Kagi's repo that presents this post in HN/Lobsters style.

This seems to be a viable way for individual bloggers to get the discoverability they miss by not being on a "big" social media platform.
For me, Kagi Small Web is a fun doomscroller-kind time killer.
When I tried importing the OPML file into my [RSS feed reader](/12_articles/71-rss-feed.md), I noticed that a uniform format and an unfiltered stream of content is not engaging at all. Most of the posts don't click with me. But when the presentation changes with every post, I spend more time exploring the content.

Can't say that I discovered anything interesting to subscribe to, though.
But that might be an effect of informational overflow.
Which is supported by my observation of myself skimming quickly through a list of 10+ unread posts, while indulging fully when I only have a couple.
