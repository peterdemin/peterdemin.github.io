Going through my old GitHub stars, I rediscovered [Shibuya](https://shibuya.lepture.com/) theme, courtesy of [Hsiaoming Yang](https://lepture.com/).
The main reason to switch is pydata theme shipping 1.4 MB of fontawesome for no good reason.
Also, I love how minimal the theme looks, leaving more space for the content.
I wish it [supported Solarized color scheme](https://github.com/lepture/shibuya/issues/105).
