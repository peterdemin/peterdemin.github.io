One thing that seems to be a upside of Golang as compared to Python, is that it's harder to do the wrong thing. Which is true due to typing, obviously. But also for the toolset.
With Python, you gotta be disciplined to keep your third-party requirements in order. It's not much work, but you also can get away without doing it. And if there's no one to catch you in action, this might bite years later.
You hire smart people, who know their stuff, but don't know Python (and are not really into learning the advanced topics of Python, because they are hired for the stuff they know well).
And they do whatever is easier to get things done.
And it's not always the right thing to do.

The path of least resistance in Python is:
- no type annotations
- no linter
- no autoformatter
- no requirement files (and no version pinning)
- no packaging
- no meaningful module and class breakdown
- no sensible docstrings or docs website.

I'm not saying this is how all the projects go.
But this is what you might get if you don't put any experienced folks on the project.

Whereas with Golang, you have to get the most of the things right, or it won't work at all.
