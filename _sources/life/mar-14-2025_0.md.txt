Some people, aspire for greater things, and manage to build their way to the goal.
Other people are happy with what they got, maybe incrementally improve situation over time, or stay in the same place and enjoy themselves.
And some people say: "Oh, if I had this and that, I would achieve great things, build something amazing."
Naturally, they never do, because that would put them in the first group.
I'd say this is some kind of a mental block, that doesn't let them to join one of the other groups.
It makes them pathologically unhappy, leading them to put the blame on external forces, government, society, status, people, anything except for their own mindset.
People who are messed up in the head and capable of action belong in the nuthouse.
Messed up in the head but incapable of action - society burden.
This is not a person's property, it only applies to some aspects and only within some timeframe.
