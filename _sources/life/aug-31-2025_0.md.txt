I rewatched [Interstellar (2014)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)) after it came up in a discussion of movie genre preferrences with my colleage, where we both agreed that it's an outstanding movie for both sci-fi and non-sci-fi fans. Suprisingly, this time, it hit me more as a parent-child relations movie. Of course I loved how all space scenes are in total silence. To that point the score was brilliant as well. But the things that made me think the most are feelings of Coop and Murph. Dr. Mann's monologue about survival instinct and human connection landed on me as a plot twist the first time I watched (ten years ago) but now I see how it supports the main theme.
One thing that makes this movie special to me, is a song by a Russian artist [Dolphin, Слышишь](https://youtu.be/2tiyg4AOmiw), released the same year, as the movie, written from the Coop to Murph, including a verse of the unbearable longing experienced by Murph.
