In times when the life feels like too much, I remind myself of the words of my high school literature teacher.
When hearing complaints from the students about how big the home assignments are and how they don't have enough time to prepare for all the subjects, she always said: "You'll take rest in afterlife."
For some students it sounded harsh, for other like a joke, but for all not much of an actionable advice.
It took me many years to understand that the idea is sound.
The life stops when you lay down in the coffin.
Until then, the purpose of life is to live it.
The more you do, the more capable you become of doing more.
On the other hand, the mind at rest weakens rapidly.
Humans adapt to good fast, and from the body's perspective concerving energy is good.
Optimizing for minimum effort to get maximum pleasure.
Which is in contrast with a notion of productive life.
One has push themselves out of the comfort zone to achieve the greatness.
Taking rest is a step back rather then a mere pause.
