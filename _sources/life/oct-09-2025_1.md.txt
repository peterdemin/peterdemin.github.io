I recently learned about Gen Z emojis:

| Emoji                         | Gen Z Meaning                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 💀 (skull)                    | I'm dying (laughing)                      |
| 🤡 (clown face)               | You're a clown                            |
| 😭 (loudly crying)            | Overwhelmed joy / cute overload           |
| 😅 (grinning face with sweat) | Stressed but okay / sarcastic             |
| 👍 (thumbs up)                | Passive-aggressive sure / OK              |
| 🙏 (folded hands)             | Thank you or please / hope so             |
| 🔥 (fire)                     | Lit / very good / attractive              |
| 👀 (eyes)                     | I’m watching / tell me more               |
| 🙃 (upside-down face)         | This is terrible / FML                    |
| ⏳ (hourglass)                | Hot / attractive                          |
| 🙂 (slightly smiling)         | Ironic / awkward smile                    |
| 😲 (shocked combo)            | Shocked / wow                             |
| 😚 (kissing face)             | Sounds good / ohhh                        |
| ❤️  (heart)                    | Softening tone — doesn't always mean love |
| 🤪 (zany face)                | Goofy / weird / silly mood                |

And here's a new addition, that I find more interesting:

👾 (space invader) means "Maybe" because maybe aliens exist.
