Utsav Mamoria in his article ["How to live an intellectually rich life"](https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich) speaks about how ideas need to be diverse and abundant. The premise is that they would combine in unexpected ways to create new better ideas. However, the article being a combination of many stories and ideas doesn't have any meaningful narrative, just the sum of its parts, that don't really fit together.
Reminds me of my friend who was working as IT support, while volunteering at the fire station and studying for a medical degree. He was very passionate about each of the three areas and expected to have them eventually click together, so he could create something on the intersection. But they never did.
