I think Sean Goedecke is onto something in his post "[Knowing where your engineer salary comes from](https://www.seangoedecke.com/where-the-money-comes-from/)".
While the post is inline with his recurring cornerstone of a mature-pragmattic-staff-engineer, he touches on a topic of different lenses to look onto a software project.
Engineers focus on problem complexity (and solution simplicity), performance, architecture and whatnot.
The bridge to business people is effort estimate in man hours.
Which translates roughly to costs of implementation.
That business people use to weight against the projected profits over the lifetime of the project (in years).
Also, weighted against the potential return from other projects that team can do instead.
I've never seen profits enter the picture for engineering planning, os it's often a kind of a dark area, of why is the deadline needs to be at this particular date.
