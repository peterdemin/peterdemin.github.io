My response to the AI panic "LLM agents are so good, they are going to replace software engineers":
1. Amount of work is unbound, you can't run out of it.
   Companies hire engineers to push more features to reach more markets.
   They don't need less people to do the same amount of work.
   The need more faster people to stay competitive.
2. Companies don't hire software engineers for their coding skills.
   They hire problem owners who deliver solutions.
   More productive problem solvers means more business to run, not less people.
