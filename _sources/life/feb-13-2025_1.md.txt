Sad [resignation letter](https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/) from Asahi Linux maintainer.
I've never used or heard about Asahi Linux before.
Or never cared about running Linux on Apple hardware, since MacOS is close enough to Linux for my uses.
But the letter clicked with me of a few topics.

One is, [hell is other people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Is_Other_People), including OSS.
I love open-source, and most of my hobby projects are public.
But not many of them see much external contribution.
The most joy I get is when I'm heads-down working on them, not when I try to align with strangers.

Another is [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law):

> [O]rganizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

I see open-source as a great organizational structure to run software projects.
But it's still prone to the problems, that any human community has.
I still wonder, though, can open-source projects governance be tweaked in ways, to solve it?..
