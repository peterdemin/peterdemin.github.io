Added [](/17_notes/31-cyberiad.md)
My next book is going to be "Material World" by Ed Conway, [refered by Mert Bulan](https://mertbulan.com/2025/10/05/my-2025-q3-highlights-favorite-books-and-movies/).
And after that I'm thinking about "We" by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which was referenced at the end of the Cyberiad.
