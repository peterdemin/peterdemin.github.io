Another example of the situation I can't quite put my finger on. When you assemble an IKEA cabinet with two kinds of bolts, a long one and a slightly shorter one.
And it's really hard to tell which one you have in hand unless you put them next to each other.
So, when you start assembling the cabinet, you put a shorter bolt in place and keep assembling until, at the last step, you are left with the longer bolt, and you realize that you actually need a shorter bolt which you used at the first step. Now, you have to disassemble the cabinet to switch the bolts.
It's a simple mistake that is not obvious at the moment but comes up later when it's harder to fix it.
