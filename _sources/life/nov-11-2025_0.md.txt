For years my life felt like a crazy race at break neck speeds, with great aspirations, challenges, achievements.
Many times I asked myself: is this all there is to it?
Other times I wondered: have I peaked; is it just downslide from here?
And sometimes I feel like I won. The game is finished and I'm on top.
Like in StarCraft, when all the enemies are neutralized, there's no more threat, but you have an option to continue "playing". Of course, at this point, there's no play, just frolicing around aimlessly, and exploring the senseless limits.
The lesson here, naturally, is that all these ideas are false, the hill has no top, it's round like Earth itself.
