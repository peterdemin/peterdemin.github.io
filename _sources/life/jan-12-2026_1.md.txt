It's been almost eleven years since the creation of "[PEP 492](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) – Coroutines with async and await syntax" by Yury Selivanov.
I've been writing asynchronous Python on and off for about a decade, and still, async/await is the most complex part of Python for me.
Recently, I wrote a synchronous generator that yields results from an asynchronous iterable. What a ride!
Back in the days of the PEP 492, Yury was working on EdgeDB, a wrapper layer around PostgreSQL.
In a way, he still is, but it's called [Gel](https://www.geldata.com), and is a part of Vercel (but the page title still says EdgeDB, lol).
Let's see what the people working on PEP 492 are up to:
- [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) - the creator and benevolent dictator of Python. Retired from Dropbox in 2019, just to join Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer in 2020.
- [Victor Stinner](https://vstinner.readthedocs.io) - one of the performance-focused Python core contributors. These days, his good work is paid for by IBM through Red Hat.
- [Elvis Pranskevichus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elprans/) - Yury's buddy, working with him in Vercel.
- [Andrew Svetlov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-svetlov/) - aiohttp maintainer, works as a VP of Engineering at Apolo.US, which at first glance looks the same as a hundred other AI startups.
- [Łukasz Langa](https://lukasz.langa.pl) - ex-Facebook core Python developer, author of Black, and release manager. Moved to a mid-sized Polish town, and doesn't show up much.
- [Greg Ewing](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/) - the winner of the ugliest homepage award.
- [Stephen J. Turnbull](https://gitlab.com/yaseppochi) - seemingly, a Mailman (The GNU Mailing List manager) maintainer.
- [Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca) - Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft in Canada and Python core developer.
- [Alyssa Coghlan](https://www.curiousefficiency.org) - Nicholas, at the time of the PEP, CPython core and packaging developer, supported by an Australian bank. Surprisingly, not working on `uv`.
The rest of the people I never heard about:
- [Paul Moore](https://github.com/pfmoore) - core developer of Python and pip.
- [Nathaniel Smith](https://vorpus.org/) - a scientist, doing science stuff, but somehow deep in the Python community.
- [Stefan Behnel](https://www.behnel.de/) - core developer of Python, maintainer of Cython and lxml.
- [Paul Sokolovsky](https://github.com/pfalcon) - author of a minimalistic Python dialect and a web framework written in that dialect.
- [Victor Petrovykh](https://github.com/vpetrovykh) - another member of the EdgeDB mafia.
- Steven D’Aprano - the only guy who got [suspended](https://discuss.python.org/t/suspending-a-core-developer-for-conduct-issues/25278) from being a Core Developer for public misconduct.
