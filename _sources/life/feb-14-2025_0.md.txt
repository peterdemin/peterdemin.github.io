TIL Talos Group of Cisco has 64 open-source repos on GitHub: https://github.com/Cisco-Talos.
Most prominent is [ClamAV](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav) - the [only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_antivirus_software) open source anti-virus toolkit.
Of course it wasn't originated inside of Cisco.
And it wasn't even the first acquisition.
And Talos Group is kinda independent company under Cisco umbrella (based in Maryland, by the way).
But still, I find this to be a cool piece of trivia.
