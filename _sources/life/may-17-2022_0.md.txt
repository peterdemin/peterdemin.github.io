Notes on stress management.
Stress management is management of body and mind. Stress is an integral part of human biology. Without stress hormones we would simple die.
1. Survival kit: sleep, eat, exercise.
2. Sleep: 7-9 hours a day. Consistent schedule for work days and weekend. Reduce screen time before sleep. Keep phone outside of bedroom.
3. Food: three colors of vegetables and fruits. 3 meals a day. Standard servings - no overeating.
4. Exercise: stretch every now and then. Brisk walks for 30 minutes.
5. Don’t need to start doing everything at once. Build good habits one step at a time. Lifestyle change feels like a hard work.
6. Avoid quick fixes: pills, drinks, energy bars, phone apps, gadgets, books, movies. Those only increase the number of things to keep track of. And the relief is only temporary.
7. Write down the goals, not just say it.
8. Note what causes stress, make a list of situations.
9. Practice simple meditation several times a day. Focus on breath and do a body scan.
10. Relax muscles while sitting, one group at a time. Neck, shoulders, arms, back, legs and feet.
11. Hang out with friends to feel social connection.
