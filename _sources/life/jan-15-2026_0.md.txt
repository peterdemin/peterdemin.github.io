I've been using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for almost all of my career, but yesterday I received an email about Sentry asking for write permissions to my repos to create pull requests made by an LLM.
I didn't enjoy the overall enshittification of the Sentry functionality over the past few years.
But this is it. That's the last drop. I'm looking for a replacement.
Preferably something self-hosted with a low CPU/RAM usage.
