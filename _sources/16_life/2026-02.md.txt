`Feb 15, 2026` - I keep playing with the Reader project.
I learned that I can't fetch a website using Javascript `fetch`.
That I can't fetch pages through iframes.
All for security reasons.
I can't fetch HTML on the server side, because with the current AI crawling environment, plenty of platforms block it.

The bookmarklet allows running arbitrary Javascript, and works in practice, but Safari doesn't let adding bookmarklets to the toolbar.
There's a workaround with favourites toolbar, but then you gotta have another horizontal row for just this toolbar.

Basically, the only technically feasible way to reformat arbitrary website the way I want it to look is to make a browser extension.
Something I wouldn't tackle before Codex.
I learned that you can make an extension for Chrome and Firefox by adding a standard `manifest.json`, which is pretty reasonable approach.
Of course, to make it available to others you need to have a paid extension marketplace account, and go through the hoops of review and what not.
Then I learned that for Safari extension, the same functionality involves like 20 files, mostly scaffolded by XCode.
A ton of bullshit, and signing, and I managed to have a Safari extension as well.

The way extension works:
1. Open a website (with one extractable main content element), and you don't like how it looks.
2. Click the circle icon in the browser toolbar.
3. Enjoy the distraction-free reading experience with large font and the best color scheme ever existed.

`Feb 14, 2026` - Today I learned that `.dev` top-level domain is [HSTS-preloaded](https://endtimes.dev/dev-and-hsts-preload/).
It means that `.dev` websites can only be accessed through HTTPS (not HTTP).
HTTPS is cool and everything, but there's a side effect.
Which comes from using VPN, and internal resources.

These days, I only consider Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.
Unfortunately, my DNS provider doesn't expose API access, which makes DNS-01 challenge automation impossible.
That leaves me with only HTTP-01 challenge, which means I need to have my host exposed to the public internet.
Which is not the case.

But hey, the resource is already accessed through a VPN, so it's encrypted in-transit the best way possible.
That makes HTTPS redundant.
Okay then, let's use plain HTTP, right?
Not if you're on `.dev` domain, you don't.
Thanks to HSTS, HTTP protocol is off-limit.

`Feb 13, 2026` - The thought of tiny flowers in a winter garden didn't leave my head for some time,
so today I vibed a wrapper around [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library
(actually, a [port](https://github.com/giulianopz/go-readability)
by [Giuliano Panzironi](https://giulianopz.github.io)).

It fetches a page from a given URL, passes it through main content extraction and cleaning,
and presents in a distraction free layout using Solarized Dark theme.

Here's an example of what it looks like:

[https://reader.demin.dev/?url=https://peter.demin.dev/life/feb-13-2026_0.html](https://reader.demin.dev/?url=https://peter.demin.dev/life/feb-13-2026_0.html)

The evening I spent openining random pages in full-screen mode and enjoying distraction free content.

In the spirit of minimalism I made this service a socket-activated Go binary.
So it doesn't take any of the precious RAM on my tiny VPS when idle,
but also has a very small runtime footprint:

```
○ reader-api.service - Reader extractor API

Feb 14 05:44:36 demin-dev reader[1325849]: 2026/02/14 05:44:36 listening on systemd activation socket
```

Can it get more minimal than that? I don't think so.

Please don't scrape whole internet through my proxy.

**UPD:** I quickly realized that in addition to being a public unauthenticated proxy, this service also exposed my VPN network in a limited way.
I considered various ways to harden this setup, and decided to just move it inside of the VPN perimeter.

So, you can't see it, but be consoled that I still use it and it's going great.

`Feb 11, 2026` - Changed my atom feed to link each item to a dedicated page (which is otherwise unreachable from the website).

`Feb 11, 2026` - My response to the AI panic "LLM agents are so good, they are going to replace software engineers":

1. Amount of work is unbound, you can't run out of it.
   Companies hire engineers to push more features to reach more markets.
   They don't need less people to do the same amount of work.
   The need more faster people to stay competitive.
2. Companies don't hire software engineers for their coding skills.
   They hire problem owners who deliver solutions.
   More productive problem solvers means more business to run, not less people.

`Feb 05, 2026` - Today I learned *why* is it bad to put knives into a dishwasher.
I thought it's because they bounce from the water streams and bump into other silverware and the cage.
But the primary reason is combination of strong detergent and high water temperature for prolonged time.
It weakens blade's edge and may degrade a handle, if it's wooden or made of a cheap plastic.
The difference in sharpness between a hand-washed and dishwashed knives is drammatic.
The sharp edge life can be reduced from a year down to a month.
