`Feb 11, 2026` - My response to the AI panic "LLM agents are so good, they are going to replace software engineers":

1. Amount of work is unbound, you can't run out of it.
   Companies hire engineers to push more features to reach more markets.
   They don't need less people to do the same amount of work.
   The need more faster people to stay competitive.
2. Companies don't hire software engineers for their coding skills.
   They hire problem owners who deliver solutions.
   More productive problem solvers means more business to run, not less people.

`Feb 05, 2026` - Today I learned *why* is it bad to put knives into a dishwasher.
I thought it's because they bounce from the water streams and bump into other silverware and the cage.
But the primary reason is combination of strong detergent and high water temperature for prolonged time.
It weakens blade's edge and may degrade a handle, if it's wooden or made of a cheap plastic.
The difference in sharpness between a hand-washed and dishwashed knives is drammatic.
The sharp edge life can be reduced from a year down to a month.
