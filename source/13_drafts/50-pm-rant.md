# Project management without project managers

**Dislcaimer:** This is a rant about an *imaginary* work environment seen from an software engineer's perspective.
All characters are fictional.

Peter joined a great team at GoJobs. The team is passionate about their product and keen on growing through iteration and feedback.
The company hierarchy seems pretty flat. There's Rashmin, a CTO, and Huina, an engineering manager who reports to the CTO and a team of engineers who report to Huina.
We're talking about R&D org, and almost everyone here is developer. Naturally, you don't see anyone who's not an developer.
The Huina's team doesn't have project managers, quality assurance, operations. Everyone on the team is a software engineer.

After onboarding and some beaurocracy, Huina is having the first actual-stuff meeting with Peter.
She explained the context, gave an overview of the past and the near future of the product, and assigned Peter his first task.
The task is to add a new feature to the product, of course.
Peter is going to be the responsible person for this feature end-to-end.
His first step is to write a design doc and review it with the stakeholders.
Huina reminded Peter that there's no project managers on her team, so Peter needs to include the motivation for the project at the beginning of his doc.

Peter is an experienced software engineer, he worked in many teams solving variety of challenges.
A common thing, though, is that every project had a dedicated project manager.
Sometimes a PM was great, sometimes not. Sometimes PM would be required, mostly in meetings they organize.
But most of the time, PM's job seemed to be unrelated and parallel to engineers' activities.
Anyway, Peter has some memories of working *with* project managers, but never had (or aspired) to be one.
Good thing, Huina's team doesn't have project managers, right?

As Peter starts to work on the task, he thinks deeply through the problem space, finding an elegant technical solution.
He finds and consults with teammates who have experience in adjusting fields.
He creates a mental picture of the final solution carefuly weighting in alternatives and tradeoffs.
Eventually, he puts that all into the design doc.
The team doesn't have a rigid structure of design docs, nor it has a golden examples of good design docs written in the past.
Good thing, less beaurocracy, more problem solving, right?

Finally, Peter sends out a link to the doc to Huina and sets up a meeting to review it and kick the ground running.
Huina asked Peter to add a couple more people to the meeting, because they are experienced architects.
As the meeting starts, Peter quickly covers the context and is ready to jump into the juicy technical stuff.
But one of the reviewers stops him with a question: "Why do want to build this?"
"Uhmm..." - Peter is slightly confused. He started working on the task because Huina assigned it to him.
He tries to recall the context he was given, but nothing answers the question exactly.
Trying to look professionally, Peter comes up with some business lingo that sounds similar to what he heard before in the meetings with managers: "This feature would improve customer retention, and speed up resolution process".
The ritual seems to be unnecessary, and Peter just wants to get through it to the *real* part of the doc.

But he gets another question: "What is the project goal?" 
"The project goal is to add this damn feature, what the hell are you talking about?" Peter doesn't say.
The meeting goes sideways, the audience is clearly not interested in all the ideas Peter had working on.
They speak some secret language, going into the topics that never mattered.
We'll skip the misery of the rest of the meeting. Let's just say that the meeting's outcome was the need to schedule another meeting.
