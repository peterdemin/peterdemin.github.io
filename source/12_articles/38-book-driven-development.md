# Book Driven Development

## Definition

Book Driven Development is a software engineering approach for organizing development process around a Book.
The Book means a single location that includes all documentation related to running a company.
The same approach can be applied to other fields as well, but author focuses on their area of expertise.

The Book is structured in way to include all business aspects and provide a place (chapter) for every topic.
As the company starts their journey, leadership fills in the table of contents, leaving the chapter contents empty.
As decisions are made, and progress is done, new paragraphs are added to the Book.

The Book is never complete, but it's always the best source of knowledge for any aspect of running the business.
Ideally, the Book alone should provide enough information to re-build the company and product from scratch.

## Table of Contents

This is how the table of contents looks for an imaginary Company.
We will use this as an example in later section for illustration purposes.
