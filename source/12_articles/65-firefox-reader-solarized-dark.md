# Solarized Dark Theme for Firefox Reader View

Firefox Reader View has a limited, non-extendable set of themes, which doesn't include [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) Dark.
Which is unfortunate because I put Solarized Dark on everything I can.

But if you want to spend 3 minutes, you can set the right palette in the Custom Theme tab.

1. For each of the four colors in the palette, click on the ✏️  button to open the color picker pop-up.
2. Switch to the "Color Sliders" tab.
3. In the sliders dropdown, choose "RGB Sliders."
4. For the "Background," enter "Hex Color #" `002b36`.
5. For the "Text," "Visited Links," and "Unvisited Links," put `839496`.
6. Leave "Highlighter for read aloud" at its default value.

And Bob's your uncle.
