# Solarized Dark Theme for Firefox Reader View

Firefox Reader View has a limited non-extendable set of themes, which doesn't have [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) Dark included.
Which is unfortunate, because I put Solarized Dark on everything I can.

But if you're willing to spend 3 minutes, you can set the right pallete in the Custom Theme tab.

1. For each of 4 colors in the pallete, click on the ✏️  button.
2. In the colorpicker switch to "Color Sliders" tab.
3. In the sliders dropdown choose "RGB Sliders".
4. For the Background enter Hex Color # `002b36`.
5. For the Text, Visited Links, and Unvisited Links put `839496`.
6. Leave Highlighter for read aloud at its default value.

And Bob's your uncle.
