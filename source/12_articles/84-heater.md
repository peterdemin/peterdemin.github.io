# Copper Coil Alcohol Heater

(Sometimes called an Alcohol Jet Burner)

## Read This First

WARNING: Non-negotiable safety rules

- Never refuel while the burner is lit or still hot.
- Keep spare fuel containers far from the burner.
- Keep ventilation open at all times.
- Keep the unit away from children, pets, and loose fabric.
- Never leave an open flame unattended while sleeping.
- Keep a working CO detector nearby in enclosed spaces.

## What It Is

- Great for small enclosed spaces like tents or a small room
- Safe to use indoors
- Bad for outdoor use - the flame blows out easily
- Can be used for heating or cooking

### Complete Heating Kit

- An Alcohol Burner
- A Safety Enclosure
- A few lighters (preferably the long-stemmed kind)
- A gallon of fuel
- Tissue or paper towels to clean the burner coil
- Optional: a second, smaller, wire mesh cylinder for cooking and a milk
  crate to keep it off the floor

### Quick Start

1. Build the copper coil burner and let the J-B Weld cure for 24 hours.
2. Build the safety enclosure (base, mesh cage, and Terra Cotta cap).
3. Fill with approved fuel, light near the fume hole, and confirm stable flame.
4. Place in a flat, ventilated area and keep spare fuel away from the unit.

### Expected Performance Ranges

- Typical burn time with an 8 oz. jar: about 5-6 hours
- Typical lighting time from cold copper: about 10-30 seconds
- Typical flame range with 5/64 inch fume hole: about 2-6 inches
- Typical water heating performance: simmer in about 10 minutes, boil in about 20 minutes (varies by fuel and setup)

## How It Works

How does it work? The burner uses nothing but fumes from the alcohol
fuel.

What makes alcohol so dangerous to burn is the fact that it’s so
incredibly flammable. This design mitigates that danger and actually
uses it to our advantage.

Alcohol fumes or vapors from the liquid fuel in the jar collect in the
copper pipe and when the pipe is heated, the fumes expand and are forced
out a tiny hole at the bottom of the copper loop (the fume or jet hole).
These fumes combust as soon as they exit and hit the open flame which
then heats the top of the copper loop. It’s a constant cycle of vaporized
fumes being forced out of the hole and then combusting.

The alcohol fumes will burn until the flow is interrupted by tipping the
burner sideways or blowing it out like a candle. This adds extra safety
as they will go out automatically if they tip over. The jar is sealed,
making it spill-proof, as well.

Is alcohol safe to burn indoors? Yes, alcohol burns very clean and is
safe to use indoors. There are more details on this in the “Fuel”
section below. The recommended fuels are Isopropyl or Ethanol
Alcohol (most commonly found as rubbing alcohol or liquid hand
sanitizer). A 6-8 oz. jar of alcohol like we use in this design can burn
for 5-6 hours. It’s also safe to cook over, so you can roast
marshmallows or use a frying pan or pot to cook over the flame.

How do you light it? The copper coil must be heated until the fumes
expand enough to start flowing out the tiny hole at the bottom of the
copper loop so they can combust.

Basically, hold a lighter (or other open flame like another lit alcohol
burner) against the copper near the fume hole until you see the flame
start to grow larger. This can take 10-30 seconds depending on how cold
the copper is.

The easiest way to light the burner is to first turn it completely
upside down for a few seconds and fill the copper loop with alcohol
fuel. When you put it upright the alcohol will drain back into the jar
but this leaves extra fumes behind and it’s easier to light.

Note: If the flame goes out, but the copper is still hot, it can be
re-lit almost instantly.

If you are using the same 1/2 inch wire mesh that we use in our design,
you can reach a long-stemmed “grill lighter” through the holes in the
wire to light or re-light the burner without moving any part of the
enclosure.

Why does the heater need the safety enclosure? This design is intended
for tents and similar structures. Open flames can burn a tent wall or
start other things on fire in an enclosed space. The jar needs a stable
surface in a tent that is often full of bedding or might have an uneven
floor. Stability is provided by the heavy dinner plate on the bottom
that acts as a weighted, flat base. The wire mesh cage ensures that the
burner has a steady supply of oxygen for safety and keeps things from
brushing against the open flame and igniting, accidentally. It also
stays cool to the touch. The Terra Cotta pot on top helps contain and
control the open flame and also heats up to provide efficient, radiant
heat.

If you have the burner sitting on a steady flat surface like a table
inside a building and there is nothing flammable around it and there is
no danger of it tipping over or pets disturbing it or getting burned and
you promise not to burn yourself playing with the flames too much... then
you don’t need an enclosure. Although, the Terra Cotta pot does help
radiate the heat to a smaller area around the burner if you are using it
for heat in a power outage or emergency situation.

## Heater Safety

The heater needs to be set up in a flat, stable place near the center of
the tent or structure with nothing immediately above it. The flame is
mostly contained but can still flicker out of the vent at the top of the
Terra Cotta pot.

It should not be left burning unattended. It will extinguish
automatically when it runs out of fuel or is tipped over, but it’s still
an open flame and still shouldn’t be left unattended. We know this will
probably happen anyway, people are cold and tired. Just be careful.

Your extra fuel should be stored away from the burner itself. If you can
put it in another tent or location entirely, that’s best, but if not
make sure the cap is tight and put it as far from the alcohol burner as
possible.

The heater can be left to burn for hours without any issues as long as
you respect which parts get very hot. It can also be used more
efficiently by doing a short 15-30 minute burn, then blowing it out and
letting the Terra Cotta contain and radiate heat for about 15 minutes
before relighting it.

### Before Lighting Checklist

- Unit is on a flat, stable surface
- Nothing flammable is immediately above or touching the unit
- Ventilation openings are clear
- CO detector is present and working
- Spare fuel is capped and stored away from the burner

### After Use Checklist

- Fully extinguish flame
- Wait for cool-down before touching hot zones
- Wipe soot from coil once cool
- Check lid seal and wick placement
- Store fuel away from heat and flame sources

### Heat Zones

HOT: The metal Jar Lid and Terra Cotta Pot will get very hot. The Terra
Cotta will heat up like an oven dish to a few hundred degrees. Touch it
only with proper padding. Or simply do not touch either of these parts
for 10-15 minutes after putting out the flame.

The copper loop gets very hot but cools very quickly. It will only stay
hot for about 2 minutes after which it will be cool enough to touch.

WARM: The Jar itself will get very warm or even hot as it picks up heat
from the metal lid but cools down in about 5 minutes. However, it only
heats up where there isn’t fuel. The liquid alcohol will act as an
insulator and the glass around it won’t get hot at all. The bottom of
the jar will stay cool.

COOL: The wire frame stays cool to the touch. You can use it to
carefully pick up and move the Terra Cotta cap if needed.

The Porcelain Plate used as a base stays completely cool and can be used
to carefully move around the hot heater unit if needed.

We have done some testing on whether the hot copper burner poses a
hazard after it goes out by keeping the hot copper part in contact with
a variety of flammable paper types and alcohol fumes immediately after
extinguishing the flame. Nothing ignited or smoldered. The burner
appears to cool too quickly. As long as nothing touches the open flame,
the risk of starting a fire is very low. It can still burn your skin
right after the flame goes out, though.

## Carbon Monoxide Safety

A very common and important question people ask is “Do alcohol burners
produce dangerous amounts of Carbon Monoxide (CO), especially in small
enclosed spaces?”

In a word: no. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is not a significant danger from
alcohol burners or stoves, because alcohol does not produce CO as a
byproduct of burning, unlike most other fuels, but the more you know
about it the better you can mitigate any possible danger.

Carbon Monoxide is an odorless and invisible gas that is given off
during combustion. The only way to detect Carbon Monoxide is with a
small, battery powered CO detector. Carbon Monoxide can poison you by
replacing the oxygen in your blood leading to flu-like symptoms that
start with headaches, fatigue, vomiting, and blacking out and can
culminate in death fairly quickly at very high CO concentrations. When
you burn things that contain carbon like natural gas, propane, gasoline,
kerosene, oil, coal, or wood, it can give off CO. With proper
ventilation the CO will usually dissipate harmlessly in the air.

This is why it’s a bad idea to burn a propane or kerosene lamp or stove
or to burn small wood fires in an enclosed area like a tent and why you
need to be careful around propane gas stoves and grills, gas generators,
smoldering wood fires lit indoors, and a car left running in a garage.
Even cigarettes produce a bit of CO. The less oxygen the fire has to
properly combust, the more CO it is likely producing. Proper ventilation
is the key to safety and why some things should only be burned outside.

It’s important to remember that any flame is capable of creating Carbon
Monoxide if it doesn’t have sufficient oxygen for combustion. However,
alcohols are much simpler chemically and not derived from petroleum.
Alcohol fuels combust completely and burn more cleanly than other fuels.
A copper coil “jet” heater will simply stop burning the alcohol fumes
without sufficient oxygen because there is no other fuel or wick to
maintain the combustion. Also, the only byproducts of pure ethanol when
burned are Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - note the 2 there, CO2 is not CO - and
water.

While tents breathe well, there are rare cases where it could be
dangerous. For example, an ice storm coating the outside of a tent (or
cabin) could create a situation where there is inadequate oxygen inside
the enclosure and anything burning would be stifled and would not
combust properly. Alcohol is one of the safest fuels to use, but there
is always a small risk of CO with any open flame. If you are concerned,
please make sure to have a CO detector nearby and always be mindful of
ventilation and oxygen levels.

## Fuel

Isopropyl and Ethanol alcohols are the fuel you want to burn in these
heaters.

### Common Fuel Types

- 70% Isopropyl rubbing alcohol
- 90% Isopropyl rubbing alcohol
- 90%-95% Distilled Liquid Hand Sanitizer (can be either kind of
  alcohol)

WARNING: Do not drink rubbing alcohol! Isopropyl alcohol and Denatured
ethanol alcohol are poisonous and can kill you even in fairly small
amounts.

Isopropyl Alcohol: Most rubbing alcohol is isopropanol-based. You’ll see it
listed as “Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol” and these are readily available at
most any grocery store or pharmacy and even most gas stations stocked
near medical or cleaning supplies. Isopropyl alcohol is poisonous when
consumed and often has additives to make it bitter so people won’t drink
it and kill themselves.

Hand sanitizer is often given out free, by the gallon, to
humanitarian organizations.

Isopropyl alcohol burns with a warm yellow flame and a tiny bit of black
soot from the additives burning off. It produces a lot of heat, but is
easy to put out.

The higher the alcohol content the better it will burn (but they all
work very well). The percentage listed on the bottle that isn’t alcohol
is mostly water and a few tiny additives.

### Denatured Alcohol

Denatured Alcohol is the other main fuel type you will see. It’s made
from Ethyl (Ethanol) alcohol, which is usually drinkable, but has been
“denatured” with bitterants and poisonous substances to make it
undrinkable and therefore subject to different regulations. It’s a very
pure distilled ethanol and is sold specifically to be used as a clean
burning alcohol stove fuel. It’s often found at hardware stores in the
paint section and at outdoor supply stores and online. It costs about
\$16 a gallon (which is about twice as expensive as 70% Isopropyl
alcohol).

Denatured Alcohol burns very hot with a blue flame and is sometimes
almost invisible.

Because it burns very hot, that makes it great for cooking.

It can be burned in these copper coil burners and works very well with
some caveats. The amount of heat it puts out makes it a lot more
dangerous. It can superheat the air in an enclosure and is

more susceptible to flare outs. It can get the Terra Cotta hot enough to
crack. The copper coil burner has to tip over almost 90 degrees before
denatured fumes will stop flowing and go out.

If you plan to burn Denatured Alcohol Fuel, use the smaller 1/16 (0.4 mm)
hole when building the copper coil and increase the height of the cap
above the flame a few more inches when cutting the wire frame for the
enclosure. Also, plan on burning it for much shorter amounts of time and
take more safety measures when handling the Terra Cotta pot and alcohol
burner itself.

![Illustration](/12_articles/images/12.84.007.webp)

These are the local average fuel costs from stores in late 2021. The
best source of fuel is still the high alcohol content liquid hand
sanitizer given out for free here. If you need to buy fuel, that’s a
pretty good estimate for what to budget. An 8 oz. jar will burn for 5-6
hours.

Generic Grain or Wheat Alcohol: Ethanol alcohol comes in many forms and
is a “drinkable alcohol”, except most industrial products aren’t
drinkable. It’s distilled to use as an equipment sanitizer or cleaning
agent and those are usually labeled as rubbing alcohol with denaturing
additives to make it undrinkable. Some geographic areas sell grain
alcohol to be used as a fuel additive or as a consumable neutral base to
add more alcohol content to other things. Grain Alcohol is just Ethanol,
often distilled in a very pure form, around 95% to 99% ABV. It will be
called Distilled Ethanol, Grain Neutral Spirit (GNS), Extra Neutral
Grain Alcohol (NGA), Neutral Grain Spirits, or Rectified Spirits at
wholesale for labs and businesses and might be marketed to consumers as
Everclear, Alcohol-95, and Golden Grain. If it’s pure and doesn’t have a
bunch of additives, almost any Ethanol can be used as a heater fuel,
however Heater Bloc has not tested most of these, we assume it burns
similar to 95% distilled hand sanitizer, but might be closer to
denatured alcohol stove fuels when burned.

WARNING: Don’t drink any of the industrial grain alcohols, even if they
aren’t denatured. It’s too pure (usually 99% ABV) and can cause alcohol
poisoning in even tiny amounts. In normal consumer use, it will be
heavily diluted.

### Fuels to Avoid

- Hand sanitizers with additives (scent, dyes, aloe, skin-care additives)
- Unknown or mixed denatured alcohol blends without ingredient disclosure
- Methanol-heavy stove fuels for indoor use

Only burn dye-free, scent-free liquid hand sanitizers in this design.
Many camping stove fuels sold as “denatured alcohol” include methanol or
other additives. Check the label before use.

### Refueling and Burn Maintenance

All of these fuels except Denatured Alcohol cause a small bit of soot
build-up on the copper coil.

It’s not flammable and is very light and powdery. It WILL cause the
heater to burn less efficiently as it can’t heat the copper coil as
well. After a few hours of burning, let it cool and clean off the soot
with a tissue or paper towel or just knock off most of it with a small
stick.

The higher the alcohol content in your fuel, the less soot tends to
build up.

Also the higher the alcohol content in your fuel, the less water it will
leave behind. A bottle of 70% Isopropyl is about 30% water. The more
alcohol fumes you burn off the more water gets left behind. If your
flame is very small or you are having trouble lighting it, that’s
probably a fuel issue. The fuel is watered down and not potent enough.
Dump it out and add fresh fuel to the jar.

## Parts and Costs

(Also your shopping list)

The cost of the Copper Coil Burner is around \$2.00 each and the
Enclosure is about \$5 in parts. Each Heating Unit in total is going to
be around \$7 on average, which is actually an amazing price point.

Ask Around Your Community: You can save a lot of money if you already
have some of the things you need. I don’t think anyone will be buying
cotton T-shirt rags if you already have an old white T-shirt to cut up.
Canning jars and dinner plates appear on garage sales all the time,
people have these things in storage. “Buy nothing groups” often have old
dinnerware.

### Find a Local Supplier

We used Big Box stores to make prices relatable out of our local region.
You might also want to find a local supplier, like a local garden store
or local hardware store, instead. Talk to your local businesses and see
if they want to help, they can sometimes order at wholesale prices.

Copper coil tubing is often used in air conditioners, ice makers,
humidifiers and refrigeration as well as small gas lines and water
lines. Talk to a local contractor or appliance store and see if they can
save short cut-off scraps for you. You only need 8 inches of copper
tubing to make a copper coil burner. Building Contractors can also buy
in bulk at slightly cheaper prices on things like silicone caulking.

Don’t Use Any Random Jar: As we documented in the Heat zones part above,
there is a heat differential in the glass from heating and cooling
different sections unequally. That can cause glass to crack or break. We
highly recommend sticking to canning and mason jars which are designed
to withstand the heat from the boiling water bath of the canning
process. After weeks of testing and use the jars have not cracked and
appear to be able to withstand the stresses. That potential to break is
always there, though, especially if using these in sub-freezing
temperatures with a very hot fuel. Heat tempered glass is ideal for
this, don’t use a random pickle jar.

Again, these are bulk prices. Your best price point is going to be
around building a dozen heaters at a time. If you only want to make a
few of these for fun, you’re going to have some extra overhead costs due
to leftover materials. The copper tubing comes in a 10 ft roll and you’ll
have a lot of extra J-B Weld (although that’s honestly pretty great
for repairs around the house). If you only make, like, 2 burners, I hope
you plan to do some canning with the other 10 jars in the pack. Maybe
build a small animal cage with the leftover hardware mesh and get a
gerbil.

More realistically, when you are done building, try to find a local
group making these for your community or even a Maker Space and donate
your extra copper and other supplies so they can build more.

You also want to budget some lighters.

The long stem ones are about \$1-3 each

Regular lighters vary from \$.25 to \$1 each.

![Illustration](/12_articles/images/12.84.012.webp)

Here’s an idea of what it’s going to cost you to make these heaters and
what you need to get started:

These are late 2021 prices and regional to Heater Bloc.

Some Alternative Prices: Things like different size canning jars or a
larger roll of copper tubing or wire mesh. You can also get cheaper
caulking, but it takes a lot longer to dry. The shorter, wide-mouth
canning jars let you use less wire for the enclosure and make it more
stable, but cost a bit more.

These lists are just a guideline. Use whatever you have available and
whatever you can find locally.

(More advice on variations and adapting to what you have appears later in this guide.)

This doesn’t include tools.

None of the tools are specialized, but you’re going to need to own or
borrow all of them. Tools needed are listed in the build sections below.

## How to Build a Copper Coil Heater

### Short Version

Cut the copper tubing to length. Fill with salt and bend into a one-inch
loop. Drill holes in the jar lid and seal the copper loop to it with J-B
Weld and let it cure. Drill a tiny fume hole. Add the wicks and fuel and
screw the jar closed.

Silicone the dinner plate so the burner and enclosure can’t slide around
and let it dry. Cut the hardware mesh to size and make a cylinder out of
it. Put the jar burner in place, add the wire cage, and put the Terra
Cotta cap on top. Test light it to make sure it works.

Give it away to someone who needs to keep warm and then make another
one. You’re done.

## How to Build the Copper Coil Jar Burner

### Tools Needed

- Safety glasses
- Handheld drill
- 5/64 drill bit
- 1/4 drill bit
- 3/8 countersink drill bit
- Hacksaw with a good metal blade or a small metal tube cutter

### Parts Needed

- Masking tape
- Table salt
- Squeeze bottle cap or tiny funnel
- Small cup or bowl of some kind to catch loose salt
- 1-inch diameter dowel or pipe or socket
- Vise (maybe)
- Sharpie
- Sandpaper (180 grit or similar)
- Scissors
- Scrap wood to drill into
- Disposable gloves (maybe)
- Paper plate or cardboard scrap
- Small clean applicator stick, like a disposable chopstick
- Optional: center punch
- Optional: small 12-inch pry bar
- 1/4 inch copper tubing (found in 10 ft and 20 ft lengths)
- Glass canning/mason jar with lid (6 oz. or 8 oz.)
- J-B Weld two-part epoxy
- Cotton T-shirt wick material

Remember if you work in teams, lots of steps can be sub-divided up. One
person can bend copper while others sand and clean up burrs. One person
can be cutting wicks while others feed them into the burners. One
person can be cutting wire while others hook the cages together.

Make the Copper Coil: (This is definitely the most involved and precise
part.)

You’re going to be drilling and cutting and deburring copper and
aluminum as well as using epoxy. Please use safety glasses to protect
your eyes when necessary.

1.  Cut a piece of copper tubing to about 10 inches in length

    Note: You could go longer than 10 inches, like 12 inches, until you get
    really good at bending it. This doesn’t have to be exact, but don’t
    crush the ends closed. The best tool to cut the copper with is a Hack
    Saw or a Metal Band Saw (if you have a shop). Copper Tube Cutters (the
    kind plumbers use with a small blade that you spin around the pipe in a
    tight space) work okay. This small copper tubing tends to crush easily
    so be gentle and not overzealous with how hard you tighten the cutting
    blade, tighten it and spin, then tighten again and spin and repeat until
    you have a nice cut. If you use a hacksaw, have a nice new blade and let
    the saw do the cutting, you don’t have to push very hard, copper is
    soft.

2.  Cap one end of the copper tube piece. Small pieces of tape honestly
    seems to work the best for this. Masking tape is the easiest to work
    with and the cheapest. Duct tape and packing tape work, too.

3.  Fill the tube with table salt using a tiny funnel or a paper cone or
    your hand that you try to cup round the tiny little hole and pour
    salt into it, you’ll make a mess, but it kind of works... the best
    tool we have found is the lid to a squeeze bottle. Like a glue
    bottle or ketchup bottle with a tiny nozzle... or something similar.
    You can buy these bottles cheap and sometimes just the caps.

    Note: It takes surprisingly less salt to fill the tube than you think it
    will.

    ![Illustration](/12_articles/images/12.84.017.webp)

4.  Tape that end closed, too

    Note: If there isn’t anything inside the tube it won’t bend, it will
    just kink and become useless. Fine sand and rock salt also work. Table
    salt seems to work the best. We tried freezing water inside it once,
    that didn’t work, either. Use salt.

5.  Set-up your pipe bending station. Find a sturdy 1-inch diameter tube
    or dowel or metal rod or large socket that you will bend the copper
    pipe around. Put this into a Vice or something similar to hold it
    securely. The key to getting a good bend in the copper tubing is to
    make sure the thing you are bending around is very secure and
    sturdy. If you are doing a bunch of these make a jig out of a wooden
    dowel or metal rod.
6.  Bend the copper tube into a complete loop around the 1-inch dowel
    using your hands. Use steady, but slow pressure.
    There are a few different types of 1/4 inch copper tubing.
    Some are thinner or weaker than others.
    Those need pressure near the dowel to bend well,
    others, need pressure out at the end of the tubing.

    Note: It can be a little bigger than an inch but you won’t really get a
    nice bend trying to go much smaller than that. Be prepared to mess up a
    few times before you start getting the bend just right. Also, you want a
    gap between the coils, if it’s too big you can flatten it a bit, but you
    don’t want them touching completely. A 1/8 to 1/4 inch gap is about
    right. The ones below got a good bend, but will probably be flattened a
    bit. If it’s too flat or close together, carefully use a wide, flat tool
    like a small 12” flat pry bar or stiff-blade putty knife to widen the
    gap a little.

### Cut and Clean Up the Copper Coil Ends

If it didn’t bend evenly, you can cut the copper tubing so both ends are
even. Shortening them is not required, it’s just for aesthetics, but it
makes feeding it into the jar lid and feeding the wicks in a lot quicker
and easier, later on. Do that here after dumping the salt.

You need to keep about 3/4 to an inch of pipe below the loop to have
enough to feed through the jar lid.

The ends can be rather rough after cutting them. We need to clean that
up a bit. Some of this is probably optional, it’ll still work if you
don’t clean anything up as long as you can get the wicks into the ends
of the copper and don’t cut yourself on the sharp edges.

1.  Remove the tape and dump the salt into a cup to be re-used. Not
    re-used for cooking, just for making more coils, it might have
    copper shards in it. Or just dump it in the trash, whatever. You can
    also use an air compressor to blow it out, or rinse it out with
    water, or even soaking it in water to let the salt dissolve, but
    shaking usually works.
2.  Clean up the burrs and rough edges. Use sand paper (180 grit works
    great) and clean up any burrs and rough edges on the outside and the
    ends of the copper tubing. Having your sandpaper on a sanding
    block helps sand the ends (or if you have a shop, use a belt
    sander).

3.  Use a 3/8 countersink drill bit and drill lightly into the end of
    the tubing to clean up the inside and remove any burrs from the
    cutting process. Making the inside smooth will also help a lot later
    when feeding in the wicking material.

    Note: A single flute counter sink drill bit is the best, if you can
    find one. Alternatively, you could just jam some small needle nose
    pliers in there and knock out any obstructions. You can find hand tools
    specifically for de-burring metal and there are handheld reamers &
    countersink tools that work instead of using the counter sink drill bit.

4.  Use a piece of loose sandpaper to rough up around the ends of the
    tubing. This is to help with adhesion of the epoxy later.
    After sanding, clean it off with a rag and some rubbing alcohol or acetone.

    Note: We didn’t include this in the tools section, but you’re going to
    want a vacuum or broom to clean up your mess when you’re done. We just
    assumed you’d realize this was going to be messy and take care of that
    without us mentioning it.

### Feed the Copper Coil into the Jar Lid

1.  Put the ends of the copper tube against the jar lid and mark where
    you need to drill. Mark the lid using a sharpie or something similar.

2.  Using a 1/4 inch drill bit and a hand drill, punch two holes through
    the jar lid. Put it down on a flat surface like a piece of scrap
    wood you don’t care about punching holes in and drill straight down.
    Don’t try to just hold the lid in your hand. Also, don’t try to
    drill it while the lid is screwed onto the jar. The bit is going to
    go through the thin metal really fast. If your bit goes through and
    hits the glass it could break the jar.
3.  Clean up burrs and rough edges on the jar lid holes with the 3/8
    inch counter sink drill bit. This part you can do while
    the lid is screwed onto the jars if you want to.
4.  Rough up the outside of the top of the metal jar lid around the hole
    with sandpaper. This will help a lot with long-term adhesion when you
    apply the J-B Weld later. After sanding, clean everything you just
    sanded with a rag or paper towel and rubbing alcohol or acetone.
5.  Feed the ends of the copper tubes through the jar lid holes.
    You’d think this would be the easiest part, but the tubing likes not
    to line up, so work it a little and bend the copper a tiny bit if
    needed.

You want the copper loop about 1/2 inch above the jar lid with at least
1/4 to 1/2 an inch of the tube inside the jar lid. You can have a lot
more inside the lid, but you don’t need more.

## Seal the Jar Lid Holes with J-B Weld

### Best Option: J-B Weld Cold Weld Twin Tube Epoxy

“J-B Weld” is a heat-safe (up to 550 degrees F) two-part epoxy that is
available at about any hardware store. We recommend the “J-B Weld Cold
Weld Twin Tube Epoxy”. The 2 oz. package can make 20-25 heaters and the
10 oz. “Pro” size is good for over 100.

The roughing up with sandpaper you did in the last two sections
will help with adhesion. If you waited a long time between these steps,
make sure the areas where you are applying J-B Weld on the jar lid and
copper coil are clean.

You’ll need a disposable mixing surface, like a paper plate or clean
piece of cardboard or scrap wood. You might need some disposable nitrile
or latex gloves.

You also need an applicator stick of some kind. Craft stores sell “Wood
Spatula Applicators” or “Craft Sticks” and similar things. Popsicle
sticks are going to be too wide. Something similar in size to a
disposable chopstick works great. In a pinch, you can cut up a free
paint stirring stick.

Follow the directions on the J-B Weld packaging, but the basic steps are
below.

1.  Mix the J-B Weld you need in small portions. Squeeze out a little
    bit in equal amounts from each tube and mix it together with your
    applicator stick. This activates the epoxy, so you don’t have very
    long to use it. A small portion can seal several jar holes.
2.  Apply a small piece of J-B Weld around each hole using the
    applicator stick. Make sure you get all the way around the copper.
    It doesn’t take very much. You also don’t have very long to use it
    before it starts to set, so glob it on there. You can smooth it out
    a little with your finger if you are wearing a disposable glove.
3.  Let it sit for a full 24 hours. Preferably, not inside your house.
    It will smell for the first few hours as it sets. The J-B Weld will
    harden in about 5-10 minutes and you’ll want to give it a full 24
    hours to be fully cured and ready for heat.

### Alternative Option: J-B Weld Steel Stick

There’s another type of J-B Weld that also works called “J-B Weld Steel
Stick” that is the same two-part epoxy, but in a putty form. It’s only
rated to 300 degrees F, though. It takes a bit more and we’ve found one
2 oz. “steel stick putty” can make about 12 to 15 heater lids. So it’s
about half as affordable as the original J-B Weld. However, it doesn’t
need to be mixed on a surface or applied with a stick. This makes it
better for “field repairs” and quick applications.

1.  Cut or rip off a small piece (about a 1/4 inch worth) of the epoxy
    putty and work it with your fingers until it mixes and activates.
    Try to get equal amounts of both the grey and black parts, which means cutting it off is
    probably safer. You really want to cover your fingers with something
    like disposable nitrile gloves, or in a pinch, a sandwich bag, but if
    you have a place to wash your hands, you don’t absolutely have to. The
    J-B Weld will become stickier and warmer as it activates.

2.  Use your fingers to work it in and around the copper pipe and jar
    lid hole. You have a short amount of time to work with it before it
    hardens. It’ll look kind of like a little putty volcano shape when you’re done.

3.  Let it sit for a full 24 hours to cure. Same as above.

### Drill the Fume Hole

After the J-B Weld is cured, you want to drill a small hole in the top
middle of the bottom copper loop.

This hole is very important and acts as the Flow Regulator for the
alcohol fumes. How big do you want that flame to get?

### Choosing a Fume-Hole Bit Size

1/16 (1.5 mm) - tends to be too small for isopropyl alcohol; the flame
will be about the size of a burning candle, but this size works great if
you are planning to use Denatured Alcohol.

5/64 (2 mm) - recommended size. It burns well, but the flame stays in
the 2-6 inch range, typically.

3/32 (2.5 mm) - the flame will vary from 2-8 inches above the hole and
tends to work well, it’s just harder to contain.

(You can always go bigger, you can’t go smaller)

Small drill bits tend to also be very short. We recommend finding one
that will let you drill straight down from the top between the copper
coils. If your drill bit is too short to drill in from the top of the
loop, you can drill carefully from the side, but get the hole in the
middle-center of the copper tubing. This is a delicate, focused step.
Only put a hole on the top side of the tube, don’t accidentally punch
all the way through both sides.

Note: If you happen to have a center punch, you can make a tiny dent in
the middle of the copper tubing to help keep your bit from slipping
while you drill. It’s not necessary, just helpful.

Add Wicking Material: A wicking material needs to be fed into the holes
in the copper tubing. This will be inside the jar and carry alcohol up
into the copper tube. Fumes coming off the wicking material will feed
the flame.

Anything plant-based seems to work: string, lantern wicks, cotton balls,
even rolled-up paper towel will work for a while.

Woven cotton (t-shirt) material is our preferred wick. It works
wonderfully and is very affordable and easy to find. Use an old white
t-shirt or handkerchief or pack of t-shirt rags and cut it into long
skinny strips. We use white so we don’t have to worry about fabric dyes
leaching into the fuel.

You need two identical wicks, one for each end of the copper tube.

The wicks need to be about 1/2 to 1 inch wide (depending on the
thickness of the cotton material) and long enough to reach the bottom of the
jar from about the center of the copper loop.

To feed it into the copper pipe, use a roll and push motion and feed it
into the tube until it’s about an inch or so above the jar lid inside
the pipe (just estimate).

Now, fill with your choice of fuel and screw the jar lid on tight. The
Copper Coil Burner is done!

## How to Build the Safety Enclosure

Building the safety enclosure part isn’t as specific as building the
copper coil burner. I’ll give you specifics on one type and a lot of
general advice on adapting this to your needs because, honestly, use
what you have and make it work. The things we can find cheap in stores
here won’t be the same where you are.

### Enclosure Components

1.  A stable, flat surface so the burner can’t tip over easily on uneven or soft surfaces and can’t easily slide around.
2.  A breathable barrier that prevents casual contact with the flame and
    reduces burn and fire risk while still allowing enough oxygen for combustion.
    This can also serve as a cooking platform for skillets and pots.
3.  A fireproof cap that keeps upward flames mostly contained and helps
    radiate and contain heat to a smaller area for better heating efficiency.

The best and most affordable solution we’ve found so far is to use a
thrifted heavy stoneware or porcelain dinner plate or wide pasta bowl
for the base, ½ inch wire “hardware mesh” (readily found at hardware
stores for building small animal cages) for the breathable cage around
the flame, and a Terra Cotta Pot as a cap for the top. Terra Cotta clay
used for rough earthen pots is heat safe and has properties similar to
an oven dish. It can take a lot of heat and makes a great flame
resistant cap. Silicone caulking is used to create thick rubbery rings
on the plate to keep burner and wire enclosure from sliding around.

The most common jar we’ve found for the burner piece is about 4 inches
tall and holds 8 oz. of fuel. There are some short 2.5-inch “wide-mouth”
mason jars that work well, too if you can find them. The shorter the
jar, the shorter your overall enclosure can be and because Terra Cotta
makes it top heavy, you don’t want to make things too tall and skinny,
so that’s a bonus. The entire design has to adapt around how tall your
jar burner is and how big your Terra Cotta piece is.

Instructions for Building an Enclosure with a 4-inch Tall Jar Burner and
a 6-inch Wide Terra Cotta Pot:

### Tools Needed

- Long-nose or needle-nose pliers
- Small diagonal cutter or a small flush cutter
- Caulking gun
- Knife to cut caulking tip open
- Wire or a nail about 3 inches long to puncture the foil seal inside the caulking tube

(Small cheap pliers and cutters work fine here.)

### Parts Needed

- Stoneware dinner plate or wide pasta bowl with at least 6 inches of flat space in the middle
- The copper coil burner (or at least the jar part of it)
- Any size roll of 1/2 inch galvanized hardware mesh (you need an 8 by 18 inch piece)
- 6-inch wide Terra Cotta pot
- Silicone caulking
- Trash can or box

### Create the Wire Cylinder

![Illustration](/12_articles/images/12.84.031.webp)

There’s a little bit of circle math here, but I’ll get into that later.
You are going to be creating a cylinder that hooks onto itself and fits
inside of the 6-inch Terra Cotta pot. The inside of the pot actually
measures about 5 1/4 inches across so your cylinder can be about 5 inches
in diameter.

A 16 inch long piece of wire will bend into a circle of approx. 5
inches. But you also need a 1 inch overlap AND you need to leave loose
wires at one end for bending.

The cylinder needs to be 8 inches tall. This leaves about 1.5 to 2
inches of empty space above the top of the copper coil burner before the
cap encloses it. This seems to be the sweet spot in trapping the heat in
the pot on top without having too much flame shooting out the vent hole
or overheating the Terra Cotta.

The cool thing about 1/2 inch hardware mesh is you don’t need to measure
it, you can just count the squares because each one measures 1/2 an
inch. If you are making a whole bunch of these, cut yourself a couple
little long skinny wire strips as guides that are the length you need to cut
each side of the enclosure for quick measuring.

1.  Open up your roll of 1/2 inch hardware mesh. It’ll want to keep its
    bend from being rolled up, use that to your advantage when making cylinders,
    don’t try to bend it the other way, it’ll make a mess.

2.  Use the angle cutters to cut a piece of wire mesh 8 inches tall and
    17 inches wide. The top and bottom of the
    cylinder need to be smooth. So does one side. After you count out 17
    inches wide go an extra half an inch and cut the wire so you have a
    bunch of wire pieces poking out on that end. You’ll bend these over to
    hold everything together. Sometimes a diagram works better.

### Wire Layout Reference

Note: The easiest way to make a bunch of these at once is to just
measure out your long side 17 inches on the curve (plus the extra
bending wires) and then cut straight down all the way. You’ll have a
piece 17 wide and 3 feet tall. Now cut that into 8 inch tall sections.
You’ll get 4 pieces and have like 2 inches of trash.

You’ll sometimes end up with a row of poking out wires you won’t need.
Like when you cut the 8 inch sections. Have a trash can or cardboard box
handy and clip these directly into it to make less of a mess.

3.  Now bend over each of the short wires to make hooks.
4.  Bend the entire piece into a cylinder and hook it together with a 1 inch (two
    little squares worth) of overlap. Use
    the needle nose pliers to bend the wires tighter once you have it hooked
    in place to make a nice tight cylinder. It can help to bend the two End
    wires up and around the top and bottom of the frame to keep it from
    sliding. If any of the wires break, don’t worry too much, there are lots
    left to hold things in place.

Make the Plate Non-Slip Using Silicone: Use “silicone caulking”
(which is a fireproof rubbery substance used for sealing around windows
and other things to keep water out) to create a thick ring of silicone
to hold the jar burner in place on the plate. Then a second ring to hold
the wire mesh cage.

1.  Cut the tip off your silicone caulking tube so you have the widest
    option possible.
2.  Puncture the foil with a wire or nail and put the tube in your
    caulking gun.
3.  Hold the Jar in the middle of the plate and put a big thick blob of
    silicone all the way around it. Spin the plate to make this easier.
    Then go around the jar again to make the silicone thicker and taller.
4.  Now add more to keep the wire mesh cylinder from slipping around.
    The best design is to make several radial silicone lines coming off
    the center ring (like sunbeams). Try to keep line thickness fairly
    even. You don’t need to make these lines as thick as the jar ring.

    Note: When you put the wire cage and pot on these silicone lines, the
    wire will sink in a little bit and keep things from sliding around. It
    works pretty well. Making a circle around the wire enclosure, like you
    did the glass jar, just doesn’t seem to work well because it has to be
    too precise. The cage can still fall over, but it won’t slide around.

    (Use a wide nail or screw or plastic wrap and tape to close off the tip
    of your silicone tube if you didn’t use it all).

5.  Leave that somewhere NOT inside your house (this stuff smells as it
    dries) for at least the first day. It’ll take about 3 days for it to
    set up completely because you’re putting it down so thick around the
    jar. Yes, really, it takes that long. If it’s too cold outside it
    won’t set at all. Putting these in a garage or utility room or shop
    is a great option, if you have it. Sometimes it’s good just to
    pre-make these plates if you have the Jars even if you haven’t done
    the copper coil part for them, yet.

    Note: 100% silicone dries faster, so that might make it more
    valuable to you to get these made quicker. The Acrylic Latex caulking
    with silicone can take over a week to dry. Get the stuff that starts
    white and dries clear so you can tell when it’s dry.

6.  After it’s dry, you’ll need to carefully cut away the silicone from
    against the glass using a small knife and wiggle the jar out of the
    silicone ring. Take a small thin blade (utility knife, small
    Leatherman, pocket knife, etc.) and just push it straight down
    between the glass and the silicone ring a bunch of times going all
    the way around the jar. That should allow you to separate the jar
    without damaging the silicone ring. When you’re done you’ll have a
    nice secure rubbery circle that will hold the jar fairly securely on
    the plate.

### Put Everything Together

Put the copper coil burner in the middle of the plate, put wire mesh
cage in place around the burner (push the cage down into the silicone a
bit), and then turn the Terra Cotta pot upside down and put it on top.
The enclosure is complete.

Note: You can decorate the plates with stickers. The plates don’t get
hot. If you want, print small instruction labels for quick field use.

### Adapt the Enclosure to Available Materials

The dinner plate we use as a base is just to provide a flat surface
because the canning jars are so skinny and prone to falling over. They
are fire-safe, fairly easy to find, and affordable both new and used. The
base part doesn’t get hot at all. You can use any portable flat surface.
Wood should work fine and you could even drill a large hole for the
burner instead of making a silicone ring. Anything non-flammable like
glass and metal platters, thick plastic cutting boards, concrete pavers,
flat terra cotta platters, and flat pottery pieces would all work fine
as a steady base for the heater. It should be several inches bigger than
your wire cage and pot in diameter, but you know, be respectful that
tents are small and don’t have a ton of space for your 3-foot-long piece
of plywood. If you want to add a plastic milk crate to use as a table
under the whole thing to raise it off of ground level, some people will
appreciate that.

We haven’t found anything that works better than galvanized wire mesh
for the cage, since it’s very affordable and easy to work with. You
could use other types of wire hardware mesh, there is a 1/4 inch version
with smaller holes that works okay. It’s just a bit harder to work with
and the wire is usually thinner, so you might have to use tie wire to
hook it together. Chicken wire wouldn’t work as it doesn’t hold weight.
We haven’t tried other fencing materials.

You can use Terra Cotta platters (the flat plate-shaped pieces that
typically go under pots and planters), as a cap on your enclosure
instead of a pot. If you do that you need to raise the wire mesh
cylinder height by several inches. The platters don’t have a vent hole
and the flame will lick out around the edges when it has no place to go.
The newer ones are also fairly thin and more prone to cracking if they
get too hot. The old, large, thick platters work very well. As a bonus,
the platters are flat and can be used as warming surfaces for things like
hot drinks.

If you want to use it for more efficient cooking, you will want to cut a
wire mesh cage that only about 1 to 1.5 inches taller than the copper
burner. The 8-inch one in the primary design above is fine for cooking,
but is not as efficient as placing the pan directly above the burner at
about 6 inches. You can also make it wider to accommodate a larger
frying pan or pot. The wire mesh cylinder can hold a lot of weight, just
make it wide enough to be sturdy. (In our tests, depending on the type
of fuel and size of the flame, you can simmer water in about 10 minutes
and boil it in about 20.) Bigger, thicker Terra Cotta pots are great! We
chose the 6-inch ones as the default because they work and they are
widely available and affordable. If you go with a bigger pot, just
adjust your wire mesh cylinder to a bigger diameter to accommodate it.
Circle Math is below.

### Bonus Circle Math

If you are using different sized Terra Cotta pots and platters for your
cap, you need to figure out how long to cut your wire for the cage
enclosure to fit them. You can start big and just use trial and error to
cut it smaller until it fits inside the pot, but it’s actually pretty
easy to figure out with math.

Measure across the Inside of the Terra Cotta Pot opening to get the
diameter of the circle you need.

The Diameter \[times\] Pi \[equals\] the Circumference - or rather the
length of the outside edge of the circle - the length you need to cut
your wire mesh to make a circle that size.

Let’s say the pot is 6.5 inches across on the inside. Pi is 3.14.

So... using a calculator to multiply... 6.5 x 3.14 = 20.41

Round up or down as needed. In this case it’s really close to 20.5
inches. Remember to also add an extra inch for overlap. Cut your wire
21.5 inches long and when you bend it into a circle you will have one
that is very close to 6.5 inches in diameter.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flame won’t start | Copper loop not hot enough | Hold flame at fume hole longer (10-30 seconds), or prime loop by flipping burner briefly |
| Flame is very small | Fuel is water-heavy or soot is insulating coil | Replace old fuel with fresh higher-percentage alcohol and clean soot from coil |
| Flame is too large | Fume hole is too big for enclosure setup | Increase cap height, improve ventilation gap, or rebuild with smaller fume hole on next unit |
| Burner goes out early | Fuel mix too diluted or wick not feeding well | Replace fuel, reseat/replace wick, verify wick reaches fuel in jar |
| Excess soot buildup | Lower alcohol percentage or contaminated fuel | Use cleaner/higher alcohol fuel and wipe coil periodically |

## Maintenance

Soot: As we said above in the Fuel section, a bit of light, powdery soot
will build up on the copper coil as you burn rubbing alcohol. The lower
the alcohol rating, the more soot seems to accumulate. This isn’t
dangerous, but it can prevent the flame from heating the copper as
efficiently, resulting in a smaller flame. When the copper coil is cool,
clean the soot off with a tissue, paper towel, leaf, stick, etc.

Fuel: When using isopropyl, it's mixed with water. 70% has about 30%
water. 90% has about 10% water. As the fuel burns and gets lower, the
concentration of water increases, so the flame seems to get smaller as
well. Eventually it will go out when there aren’t enough fumes to
sustain the flame. When refilling, it's recommended to dump out the old
fuel and add fresh alcohol if the flame is weak.

Wick: If the wicking material falls out of the copper pipe inside the
jar - just stick it back in. If it happens a lot, get a thicker piece of
cotton cloth to replace it. If the wicking material is thick enough, it
won’t fall out.

Seal on top of the lid: Sometimes after a lot of use or if the copper
piping gets wiggled back and forth too much the J-B Weld holding it to
the lid will crack or loosen from the lid. You can still use the burner,
but might lose some fuel to evaporation and it won’t be completely spill
proof. You can pull the pipe out of the lid, break and clean off the old
J-B Weld, and reapply new J-B Weld. A premium silicone would also work
in a pinch. The holes need to be sealed well so the alcohol doesn’t
spill or evaporate.
