    I also modified the output of the outline to guide the process.

Introduction
------------

It's 2024, I'm the new president of the United States. For the next four
years, my main areas of focus are just two:

#. Healthcare Reform: The medical insurance system is deeply broken. The
   prices are too high, while the salaries of the healthcare workers are
   incomparably small. The only party that benefits from healthcare
   system is insurance. We must redo it from the ground up. Reducing
   patient bills, eliminating middle-men, and improving the work-life
   balance of healthcare workers.
#. Educational Reform: US education is in a bad state. The price for
   getting a degree in a demanding field is above what a person can make
   working in that field. At the same time teachers are under a great
   stress, that causes record-high attrition. We must rebuild the
   schools and universities to make high quality education an affordable
   reality for each US citizen.

I choose to intentionally ignore other topics, like Criminal Justice
Reform, Infrastructure Modernization, Social Equity and Inclusion,
Disaster Preparedness and Response. My step-by-step plan for improving
US Healthcare and Educational systems is as follows.

However, challenges may arise in terms of long waiting times for certain procedures and potential limitations in choices for patients seeking specialized care.

E. Private Health Insurance Models:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Private health insurance models rely on a predominantly market-driven approach, with private insurance companies playing a central role in providing coverage and managing healthcare services.
The United States is a notable example of a country with a primarily private health insurance model.
Private insurance models offer individuals a wide range of coverage options and fast access to medical services.
However, they can result in high administrative costs, coverage gaps, and the potential for unequal access to care based on financial means.

F. Direct Government Provision Models:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In direct government provision models, the government owns and operates healthcare facilities and employs healthcare workers to provide medical services directly to the public.
Cuba's healthcare system is an example of a direct government provision model.
This approach often prioritizes equitable access to care, preventive services, and community-based care delivery.
While direct government provision can lead to consistent and cost-effective care, challenges may arise in terms of resource allocation, technological advancements, and potential limitations in specialized care options.
