The president program
=====================

.. _h.77zvlvg5po6b:

Introduction
------------

It's 2024, I'm the new president of the United States. For the next four
years, my main areas of focus are just two:

#. Healthcare Reform: The medical insurance system is deeply broken. The
   prices are too high, while the salaries of the healthcare workers are
   incomparably small. The only party that benefits from healthcare
   system is insurance. We must redo it from the ground up. Reducing
   patient bills, eliminating middle-men, and improving the work-life
   balance of healthcare workers.
#. Educational Reform: US education is in a bad state. The price for
   getting a degree in a demanding field is above what a person can make
   working in that field. At the same time teachers are under a great
   stress, that causes record-high attrition. We must rebuild the
   schools and universities to make high quality education an affordable
   reality for each US citizen.

I choose to intentionally ignore other topics, like Criminal Justice
Reform, Infrastructure Modernization, Social Equity and Inclusion,
Disaster Preparedness and Response. My step-by-step plan for improving
US Healthcare and Educational systems is as follows.
