# Tell me a story about how you coached a team member

During my tenure at Moveworks, I faced a significant challenge that reshaped my approach to team management. When I joined the company, it was a bustling startup with around 50 engineers, and I was tasked with overseeing a critical product component. Initially, I worked alone in this area, but as the team expanded, I was assigned a teammate.

In the beginning, our strategy was straightforward: divide and conquer. This approach boosted our productivity in the short term, allowing us to tackle more tasks with minimal communication. My colleague was skilled and independent, which meant I seldom needed to intervene.

However, after a year of this work pattern, I was taken aback when my teammate was unexpectedly dismissed. I later discovered that personal challenges had affected his performance, a situation I had been unaware of due to our isolated working style. This experience was a wake-up call for me, highlighting the importance of close collaboration and open communication within a team.

When we welcomed a new member, who was less experienced with our technology stack, I changed my approach. Despite my own workload, I committed to daily 1:1 meetings with him. These sessions were not only about technical guidance in Python and scalable software development but also about fostering a strong team bond and understanding each other's work styles.

This investment in team building paid off. Over the next six months, we developed a cohesive and efficient partnership, capable of seamlessly covering for each other during absences and peak times. For instance, when my colleague was on vacation, an urgent issue arose with a key customer. I handled the situation and later briefed him, ensuring he maintained ownership of the project. Similarly, he demonstrated his growth and reliability by adeptly managing a critical task during a particularly busy period for me.

In conclusion, this journey at Moveworks taught me the value of proactive team engagement and the importance of understanding the challenges faced by team members. It was a demanding process, but it fostered a robust and supportive team environment and led to a meaningful professional relationship that extended beyond my time at the company. This experience has profoundly influenced my approach to leadership and team dynamics.
