# Tell me a story about how you coached a team member

This is the story I like to share during behavioral interviews.

This was during my time at Moveworks. The team was about 50 engineers when I joined.
As it usually goes with startups, everyone was streched thin across many projects,
and the bus factor for many areas was one.
For several years I was a directly responsible individual for a critical part of the product.
When I got my first team mate, I was so busy with the tasks, that our collaboration strategy become splitting the work.
It was great for the short-term productivity, as we got double the bandwidth, with zero communication overhead.
The team mate was capable, and I rarely had to step in for any issues.

We worked the way for about a year, and then suddenly I learned that my team mate was let go by our manager.
This came out of the blue, and I later learned that due to personal situtation, he struggled at work, and the performance dipped a bit.
I lost a team mate and got double the work in an area that I wasn't paying much attention before.

Few month later we got a new hire. The guy never worked with our stack before and was on a more junior side.
But I learned a lesson, and as soon as he started, I've set up daily 1:1 call to talk about the tech and the team.
With my hands still full and juggling priorities, I took extra time make sure my team mate succeeds with their projects.
For a few months I would share best practices working with Python, and building scalable software.
It was considerable effort, and my hands were already full.
But the personal connection and satisfaction from observing his progress motivated me to keep going.

Half a year later, we were a solid team. We could step up on each others urgent tasks and cover for vacations and sickness.
Once at the second day of my buddy's vacation we got an urgent escalation from a very important customer.
I already new the project well, and promptly delivered the solution in time before he got back from vacation.
Once he was back, I explained the design and tradeoffs I made, and effectively handed off the solution to him.
This way, he still got full ownership of his area, and was able to explain the details and make changes autonomously to the code I wrote.

Another time, I was on 2 escalations, and we got a third one. There was no way to complete all tasks in time for me working alone. He stepped up, and delivered the task swiftly and with high quality.

In conclusion, my deliberate effort in team building was demanding in short term, but led to a healthy team environment, and created a friendship that lasted beyond my tenure at Moveworks.
