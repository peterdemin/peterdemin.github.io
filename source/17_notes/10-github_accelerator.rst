GitHub Accelerator
==================

Article: https://accelerator.github.com/

Notes
-----

Github started this accelerator with a board of open source projects
evaluators from some of the most respectful open-source figures.

Each project gets $20,000 split by $2,000 per week for 10 weeks.
Project maintainers must attend all activities for the program and share their experience.
