Here are some of my favorite quotes from songs.
I catch myself reciting this one during tough debug sessions:

    Goddamn machinery
    Why don't you speak to me?
        -- "The Axe" by Thom Yorke


And this I love for the structure of the sentence:

    When I am king
    You will be first against the wall
    With your opinion
    Which is of no consequence at all
        -- "Paranoid Android" by Radiohead


This one is for "broken pipe" and "Socket closed":

    Communication breakdown, it's always the same
    Havin' a nervous breakdown, a-drive me insane
        -- "Communication Breakdown" by Led Zeppelin

TIL that US schools close in observance of the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr, a festive celebration marking the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide.
But they call it Quarterly grading/planning. Maybe to not stir the masses.
