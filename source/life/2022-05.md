`May 20, 2022` · On delegation. 

As a person who spent a lot of time in government facilities, I developed an acute case of red line allergy.
Not all bureaucratic process are inherently bad though. A line to the cashier is arguably the best way to coordinate buyers in a shop to share a limited resource of cashier’s time.

I think the common pattern of harmful policies is separation of problem, goals, decision and rules. Everyone could be doing their best, and still the system as a whole is terrible.

Here’s how it works. Once upon a time there was a _problem_. Some important smart guy created a *goal* to solve or mitigate the problem. Some less important folks made a set of *decisions* to achieve the *goal*. Those decisions were passed down to the least important crowd in the organization to make them *rules* and put mindless minions in charge of enforcing those rules. 

Decision makers working on the goal didn’t see the problem clearly. Policy makers working on the rules didn’t care about neither goal nor problem. Rule enforcers never asked about the decisions.

And here I am, banging my head against the layers of walls, trying to get things done, but jumping hoops instead. 

If I were to make it right, I’d let rule enforcers solve the problem on their own. So that they can be in charge of their decisions. And so that they would know when to break the rules. You may say that it’s not scalable, but I’d say it’s a matter of where to cut the delegation. At the lowest level, horizontally, or at the problem level, vertically.

`May 17, 2022` · Notes on stress management. 

Stress management is management of body and mind. Stress is an integral part of human biology. Without stress hormones we would simple die. 

1. Survival kit: sleep, eat, exercise. 
2. Sleep: 7-9 hours a day. Consistent schedule for work days and weekends. Reduce screen time before sleep. Keep phone outside of bedroom. 
3. Food: three colors of vegetables and fruits. 3 meals a day. Standard servings - no overeating. 
4. Exercise: stretch every now and then. Brisk walks for 30 minutes. 
5. Don’t need to start doing everything at once. Build good habits one step at a time. Lifestyle change feels like a hard work. 
6. Avoid quick fixes: pills, drinks, energy bars, phone apps, gadgets, books, movies. Those only increase the number of things to keep track of. And the relief is only temporary.
7. Write down the goals, not just say it. 
8. Note what causes stress, make a list of situations. 
9. Practice simple meditation several times a day. Focus on breath and do a body scan. 
10. Relax muscles while sitting, one group at a time. Neck, shoulders, arms, back, legs and feet.
11. Hang out with friends to feel social connection.

`May 10, 2022` · I just tried to explain gender transformation to my kids in popular Soviet song:

> Я был когда-то странной игрушкой безымянной.

Protagonist is a male (animal), but he was a toy in the past.
But toy's gender is feminine.
Which makes a weird mix of two genders in one sentence separated by the time.

The opposite example blew their minds:

> Я была когда-то странным утюгом безымянным.

Here are some of my favorite quotes from songs.
I catch myself reciting this one during tough debug sessions:

    Goddamn machinery
    Why don't you speak to me?
        -- "The Axe" by Thom Yorke


And this I love for the structure of the sentence:

    When I am king
    You will be first against the wall
    With your opinion
    Which is of no consequence at all
        -- "Paranoid Android" by Radiohead


This one is for "broken pipe" and "Socket closed":

    Communication breakdown, it's always the same
    Havin' a nervous breakdown, a-drive me insane
        -- "Communication Breakdown" by Led Zeppelin

TIL that US schools close in observance of the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr, a festive celebration marking the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide.
But they call it Quarterly grading/planning. Maybe to not stir the masses.
