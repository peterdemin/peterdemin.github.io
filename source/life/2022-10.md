`October 6, 2022` · What's the name for it?

* You are going to get a lunch at home;
* But you need a clean plate;
* All plates are dirty and stacked in a kitchen sink;
* You're out of dish washing liquid, and have to use dishwasher;
* Dishwasher is already full with dirty cups;
* You're out of dishwasher tablets, and need to buy them;
* Closest store is closed, and you need to drive to the next one;
* Car has a flat tire, that has to be fixed first, and you need to get to tire shop;
* Car is out of gas, and you need to get the gas by foot.

This example is long and unrealistic, but I see this happening all the time.
Solution for a small problem is blocked by something else, that requires significantly bigger effort.
Is it akin to technical debt? Just not exactly technical.


`October 3, 2022` · Scratched my self-hosting itch with two new additions to my home server:
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) and [Storj](https://www.storj.io/).
* Nextcloud is a bit weird Snap installation with PHP, MariaDB, and Redis.
  I don't feel comfortable exposing self-managing PHP applications (read Wordpress-level security),
  so I've put it behind my 2FA cloud proxy. And of course it doesn't work well with the Nexcloud mobile client.
  Aside from security, performance on my old home server is not that great.
  Image previews are generated on-demand, so it takes awhile to see my 300 GB photo gallery.
  Apple live photos seem to have no support too. All in all, I don't think it can replace Google Photos, as I hoped.
* Storj is an implementation that I had another day. Pretty good one.
  Set up could have been better streamlined, so it took few hours to hook up a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2 TB external HDD storage.
  As a side effect I know have an Etherium wallet, that should be used for pay outs. We'll see.
  Overall, I like their implementation a lot. From ideation to performance and security aspects.
  I wish I could make it bare-metal, but I caved too early and went with the recommended Docker installation.
