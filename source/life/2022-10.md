`October 3, 2022` Â· Scratched my self-hosting itch with two new additions to my home server:
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) and [Storj](https://www.storj.io/).
* Nextcloud is a bit weird Snap installation with PHP, MariaDB, and Redis.
  I don't feel comfortable exposing self-managing PHP applications (read Wordpress-level security),
  so I've put it behind my 2FA cloud proxy. And of course it doesn't work well with the Nexcloud mobile client.
  Aside from security, performance on my old home server is not that great.
  Image previews are generated on-demand, so it takes awhile to see my 300 GB photo gallery.
  Apple live photos seem to have no support too. All in all, I don't think it can replace Google Photos, as I hoped.
* Storj is an implementation that I had another day. Pretty good one.
  Set up could have been better streamlined, so it took few hours to hook up a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2 TB external HDD storage.
  As a side effect I know have an Etherium wallet, that should be used for pay outs. We'll see.
  Overall, I like their implementation a lot. From ideation to performance and security aspects.
  I wish I could make it bare-metal, but I caved too early and went with the recommended Docker installation.
