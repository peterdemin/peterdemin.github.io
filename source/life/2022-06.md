I picked up running a week ago. Todayâ€™s personal best is 4 km in 23 minutes.

Fun fact: here's what happens when you burn a molecule of triglyceride, the predominant fat in a human body:

C55H104O6+78O2 --> 55CO2+52H2O+energy.

Oxidizing 10 kilos of human fat requires inhaling 29 kilos of oxygen to produce 28 kilos of carbon dioxide and 11 kilos of water. It means that you lose roughly the same amount of fat as you sweat.
