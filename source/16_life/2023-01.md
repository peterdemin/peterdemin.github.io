`January 7, 2023` · My favourite Chipotle order: salad bowl, no rice, pinto beans, chicken, grilled veggies,  tomatoes, sour cream, shredded cheese, guac, and lettuce on top.
It has nice balanced taste, healthy combination of ingredients, and sane number of calories.
Chipotle offers some junk food options, but it's possible to pick just the good stuff.
These days, it's my first choice in the shopping mall food courts.
