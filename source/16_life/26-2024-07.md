`Jul 02, 2024` - I have this idea about people who live routine lifes and don't want to change anything about it.
I picture a man who lies in a mud puddle.
Like these therapeutic mud bath spas.
While he's moving the limbs, the mud stays liquid.
When he stops moving, the surface of mud dries out and becomes hard and sharp crust.
The crust traps the man an making any movement is now takes significant effort and hurts.
Without movement it's comfortable, though.
