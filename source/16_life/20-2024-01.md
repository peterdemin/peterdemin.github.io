`Jan 15, 2024` - Listening to [Дельфин — ПРОЩАЙ ОРУЖИЕ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDlGGCXnUwA).
From song to song he touches on same set of topics.
Which as the same topics he touched in his previous album.
And the album before that.
It's as if a person has, say, 3-4 major themes in life.
And whenever he gets inspiration, it's gonna be something among those lines.
Which made me think, what are the major themes for me, and for the people I know.
So far, the morning slumber theory checks out.

`Jan 11, 2024` - This Herbert guy, I've got questions.
Is he happy? Does he feel fullfilled and content?
Is he doing it out of passion, or is there someone else paying him to do it?
Does he feel like a robot? Did he choose this life?
Is it a stepping stone to achieve something different?

`Jan 11, 2024` - Distinction without differentiation, efficiency without effectiveness.

`Jan 06, 2024` - Set up the Apple Weather app to ping you whenever it rains in Seattle, and never pick up your phone to an empty notification screen.

`Jan 06, 2024` - Picture a person in spacious room. His name is Herbert.
He's a scientist and he studies and works all day long without any need for going out, making food, doing laundry, nothing. 
He has no distractions, he's fully focused on his work.
No Netflix, no games, no TV at all.
Yet, he has access to all the information he needs for work.
No people, except for brief visits of housekeeping.
Perfectly balanced diet, regular sleep schedule, no viruses, no disturbances.

`Jan 05, 2024` - Another example of the situation I can't quite put my finger on. When you assemble an IKEA cabinet, which has two kinds of bolts, a long one and a slightly shorter one.
And it's really hard to tell which one you have in hand unless you put them next to each other.
So, when you start assembling the cabinet, you put a shorter bolt in place and keep assembling until at the last step you are left with the longer bolt and you realize that you actually need a shorter bolt which you used at the first step and now you have to disassemble the cabinet to switch the bolts.
It's kind of a simple mistake that is not obvious at the moment, but that comes up later when it's harder to fix it.

`Jan 04, 2024` - Here is a bureaucratic game idea.
Classic arcade game setting with a top-down view and simple cartoonish graphics.

**First level.** 
You stand in line, and the line moves slowly (left to right on the screen).
Each person in front of you moves a split second after the person in front of them.
Your goal is to catch up as quickly as possible.

**Second level.**
There are human hunters standing a few people after you, and they are shooting at you.
You must dodge their bullets, and when you dodge, the bullet kills a person in front of you.
When the person in front of you dies, you can take their spot, which speeds up your progressions through the line.

**Third level.**
While standing in line, you also need to fill in a form.
This form includes some math quizzes.
While filling out the form, you keep dodging the bullets, making sure that bullets don't hit the person who will be accepting your form who stands in front of you.
