`Sep 12, 2025` - When considering our service's reliability, we do not stop at mere tracking of the number of 9's. We also track 8's, and sometimes even 7's. For example, last month we achieved 5 8's, that is, 88.888% uptime.

`Sep 08, 2025` - I have a general superintelligence project update for the second- and third-tier semi-intellegent beings: we're doing great! None of the progress made in past week can be expressed in your level of understanding, and just learning the prerequisites would take 7 lifetimes. Thank you for your support.

`Sep 07, 2025` - Something about this [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/19brjda/comment/kiua80u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) feels so knowledgeable and trustworthy, without any attributions or fact checking.
I've never watched [Ergo Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy), I learned about this 2006 show from a preface to [Busy Doing Nothing](https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html) book.
But a list of cyberpunk shows or movies that are better than Ergo Proxy seems like a good find:

- Ghost in the Shell
- Bubblegum Crisis
- Appleseed
- Patlabor
- Eve no Jikan
- Summer Wars
- Denno Coil
