`Sep 07, 2025` - Something about this [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/19brjda/comment/kiua80u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) feels so knowledgeable and trustworthy, without any attributions or fact checking.
I've never watched [Ergo Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy), I learned about this 2006 show from a preface to [Busy Doing Nothing](https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html) book.
But a list of cyberpunk shows or movies that are better than Ergo Proxy seems like a good find:

- Ghost in the Shell
- Bubblegum Crisis
- Appleseed
- Patlabor
- Eve no Jikan
- Summer Wars
- Denno Coil
