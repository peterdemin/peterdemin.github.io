`Feb 05, 2026` - Today I learned *why* is it bad to put knives into a dishwasher.
I thought it's because they bounce from the water streams and bump into other silverware and the cage.
But the primary reason is combination of strong detergent and high water temperature for prolonged time.
It weakens blade's edge and may degrade a handle, if it's wooden or made of a cheap plastic.
The difference in sharpness between a hand-washed and dishwashed knives is drammatic.
The sharp edge life can be reduced from a year down to a month.
