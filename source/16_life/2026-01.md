`Jan 09, 2026` - Mildly interesting idea: use GitHub CLI to export repos I starred and inject this information into my public journal.

```bash
gh api --paginate users/peterdemin/starred --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.star+json' | jq . > gh-stars.json
```

`Jan 09, 2026` - Here's some food for thought.
We got some nice green seedless grapes from Costco, but they were super tart.
If you let unripe grapes sit on a dark shelf for a couple of days, they'll get sweeter.
But they won't get more callories, because of the laws of conservation.
The grape is sealed and its carbohydrates don't go anywhere.
But my mind tricks me into thinking that sweet food provides more energy.

`Jan 03, 2026` - After watching Mr. Robot I got curious about IPFS in general and Anna's Archive in particular.
I found this [gem](https://software.annas-archive.li/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/issues/305) in Anna's Archive Git repo:

> Here is an extreme case for most, but very real for Anna's Archive, Libgen or Z-Library operators.
>
> - If you are under heavy police pressure from a surveillance government like the US, you are better off using a Live USB and a VPN with killswitch enabled when connecting to your server(s), avoid DNS leaks to Google or your ISP, and so on.
> - Consider using a disposable device for it. Canvas fingerprinting is a real thing.
> - Consider using a disposable disk for it and be prepared to dump it away. Disk forensics is also a thing.
> - Proton suite is unsafe and a honeypot, please do not use it. Tuta is a much better option.
> - Tor is slow, overhyped, flagged by tons of web firewalls, and not useful for pirating. Your traffic will stand out like a bright red light. I would strongly discourage using it for clearnet browsing. Hosting and browsing onion services is fine.
> - You will need to connect with people on platforms like Signal or Telegram, where you need to use a phone number to register. Services like https://hstock.org and https://sms-activate.org do help a lot. If you use yours and police request your data, you are fucked.
> - Do not expect services to encrypt your data, do it yourself. E2EE is a fairytale unless you actually set it up.
>
> Get cryptocurrency in an anonymous way, and start using it!

I feel something romantic about this level of paranoia.
Luckily, neiter I nor anyone I've ever met had to apply any of these technics.
