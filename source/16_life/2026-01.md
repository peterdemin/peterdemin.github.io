`Jan 22, 2026` - For *years* I had these lines in my `~/.vimrc`:

```
set background=dark
" set background=light
```

I would go and move the comment to the other line whenever I needed to switch to another mode.
Until today, I discovered this [jewel from Vinit Kumar](https://vinitkumar.me/current-vim-setup/):

```vim
function! ChangeBackground()
  if system("defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle") =~ '^Dark'
    set background=dark
  else
    set background=light
  endif
endfunction
call ChangeBackground()
```

It detects the current Appearance setting and picks the corresponding Solarized theme.

Thank you, Vinit! And thanks to [hnpwd](https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io) for connecting me with Vinit!

`Jan 22, 2026` - Here is a metaphor for how big tech companies operate that comes to mind over and over and seems to apply to many situations.
A small company operates like a chess master: the pieces move in a tight choreography, and even when it's not clear for each separate pawn, there is a big picture, and it makes sense at the end.
As the company grows, when no one knows how many teams are in the org, not to mention the names of the people, there ain't no chess master at the helm.
Each piece is moved by a number of people who rarely communicate and have different goals.
Coordination between pieces is eventual and minimal.
There's a lot of effort exerted, and the amount of motion is dizzying.
Yet, rarely are substantial improvements achieved, and never efficiently.

`Jan 21, 2026` - Exploring Radicle landed me on [Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org). I'm concerned with the eth- prefix in their domain name, and a mention of blockchain and web3 on the main page. But I like how they managed to build some community and ecosystem around this project. Fun fact: instead of regular documentation, they have [The Book of Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/the-book-of-swarm-2.pdf) of 272 pages. I wonder how much of it is AI slop, though.

On the note of automatic distribution of 4KB chunks through the network, I wonder how long before DMCA watchdogs start sending their letters to all owners of a chunk of a copyrighted content.
With IPFS and BitTorrent node owner at least controls what content to store and serve.

`Jan 21, 2026` - This looks like a trend, and I don't know how I feel about it:
- HN post "[Ask HN: Share your personal website](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618714)" got 947 points and 2382 comments. The repo received 100+ pull requests in 7 days.
- Its predecessor from 2023 "[Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618714)" got 1014 points and 1940 comments.
- The scrape of that post [started](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb/) - a random blog browser, powered by a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb).
- [RSS.Social](https://rss.social) - feed syndicator from Kagi's repo that presents this post in HN/Lobsters style.

This seems to be a viable way for individual bloggers to get the discoverability they miss by not being on a "big" social media platform.
For me, Kagi Small Web is a fun doomscroller-kind time killer.
When I tried importing the OPML file into my [RSS feed reader](/12_articles/71-rss-feed.md), I noticed that a uniform format and an unfiltered stream of content is not engaging at all. Most of the posts don't click with me. But when the presentation changes with every post, I spend more time exploring the content.

Can't say that I discovered anything interesting to subscribe to, though.
But that might be an effect of informational overflow.
Which is supported by my observation of myself skimming quickly through a list of 10+ unread posts, while indulging fully when I only have a couple.

`Jan 20, 2026` - Something up my alley: [SelfCI](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/radicle.dpc.pw/rad%3Az2tDzYbAXxTQEKTGFVwiJPajkbeDU) - a minimalistic local-first Unix-philosophy-abiding CI.

`Jan 16, 2026` - I got into this trap twice, so I guess I might not be alone.
I review someone else's code, and I get a strong feeling it was AI-generated.
Because no human could possibly produce this kind of well-documented, type-annotated mindless slop.
I feel offended for author being careless and pushing through slop without control.
I ask the author whether they reviewed the generated code themselves before pushing it.
They tell me they didn't use AI.
They wrote the code themselves.

`Jan 15, 2026` - I've been using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for almost all of my career, but yesterday I received an email about Sentry asking for write permissions to my repos to create pull requests made by an LLM.
I didn't enjoy the overall enshittification of the Sentry functionality over the past few years.
But this is it. That's the last drop. I'm looking for a replacement.
Preferably something self-hosted with a low CPU/RAM usage.

`Jan 12, 2026` - It's been almost eleven years since the creation of "[PEP 492](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) – Coroutines with async and await syntax" by Yury Selivanov.
I've been writing asynchronous Python on and off for about a decade, and still, async/await is the most complex part of Python for me.
Recently, I wrote a synchronous generator that yields results from an asynchronous iterable. What a ride!
Back in the days of the PEP 492, Yury was working on EdgeDB, a wrapper layer around PostgreSQL.
In a way, he still is, but it's called [Gel](https://www.geldata.com), and is a part of Vercel (but the page title still says EdgeDB, lol).

Let's see what the people working on PEP 492 are up to:
- [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) - the creator and benevolent dictator of Python. Retired from Dropbox in 2019, just to join Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer in 2020.
- [Victor Stinner](https://vstinner.readthedocs.io) - one of the performance-focused Python core contributors. These days, his good work is paid for by IBM through Red Hat.
- [Elvis Pranskevichus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elprans/) - Yury's buddy, working with him in Vercel.
- [Andrew Svetlov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-svetlov/) - aiohttp maintainer, works as a VP of Engineering at Apolo.US, which at first glance looks the same as a hundred other AI startups.
- [Łukasz Langa](https://lukasz.langa.pl) - ex-Facebook core Python developer, author of Black, and release manager. Moved to a mid-sized Polish town, and doesn't show up much.
- [Greg Ewing](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/) - the winner of the ugliest homepage award.
- [Stephen J. Turnbull](https://gitlab.com/yaseppochi) - seemingly, a Mailman (The GNU Mailing List manager) maintainer.
- [Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca) - Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft in Canada and Python core developer.
- [Alyssa Coghlan](https://www.curiousefficiency.org) - Nicholas, at the time of the PEP, CPython core and packaging developer, supported by an Australian bank. Surprisingly, not working on `uv`.

The rest of the people I never heard about:
- [Paul Moore](https://github.com/pfmoore) - core developer of Python and pip.
- [Nathaniel Smith](https://vorpus.org/) - a scientist, doing science stuff, but somehow deep in the Python community.
- [Stefan Behnel](https://www.behnel.de/) - core developer of Python, maintainer of Cython and lxml.
- [Paul Sokolovsky](https://github.com/pfalcon) - author of a minimalistic Python dialect and a web framework written in that dialect.
- [Victor Petrovykh](https://github.com/vpetrovykh) - another member of the EdgeDB mafia.
- Steven D’Aprano - the only guy who got [suspended](https://discuss.python.org/t/suspending-a-core-developer-for-conduct-issues/25278) from being a Core Developer for public misconduct.
- Ethan Furman
- Jim J. Jewett

`Jan 12, 2026` - I got curious if smartphone notifications can be possibly implemented in a privacy-preserving fashion (and to what extent).

`Jan 10, 2026` - Going through my old GitHub stars, I rediscovered [Shibuya](https://shibuya.lepture.com/) theme, courtesy of [Hsiaoming Yang](https://lepture.com/).
The main reason to switch is pydata theme shipping 1.4 MB of fontawesome for no good reason.
Also, I love how minimal the theme looks, leaving more space for the content.
I wish it [supported Solarized color scheme](https://github.com/lepture/shibuya/issues/105).

`Jan 09, 2026` - Mildly interesting idea: use GitHub CLI to export repos I starred and inject this information into my public journal.

```bash
gh api --paginate users/peterdemin/starred --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.star+json' | jq . > gh-stars.json
```

`Jan 09, 2026` - Here's some food for thought.
We got some nice green seedless grapes from Costco, but they were super tart.
If you let unripe grapes sit on a dark shelf for a couple of days, they'll get sweeter.
But they won't get more callories, because of the laws of conservation.
The grape is sealed and its carbohydrates don't go anywhere.
But my mind tricks me into thinking that sweet food provides more energy.

`Jan 03, 2026` - After watching Mr. Robot I got curious about IPFS in general and Anna's Archive in particular.
I found this [gem](https://software.annas-archive.li/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/issues/305) in Anna's Archive Git repo:

> Here is an extreme case for most, but very real for Anna's Archive, Libgen or Z-Library operators.
>
> - If you are under heavy police pressure from a surveillance government like the US, you are better off using a Live USB and a VPN with killswitch enabled when connecting to your server(s), avoid DNS leaks to Google or your ISP, and so on.
> - Consider using a disposable device for it. Canvas fingerprinting is a real thing.
> - Consider using a disposable disk for it and be prepared to dump it away. Disk forensics is also a thing.
> - Proton suite is unsafe and a honeypot, please do not use it. Tuta is a much better option.
> - Tor is slow, overhyped, flagged by tons of web firewalls, and not useful for pirating. Your traffic will stand out like a bright red light. I would strongly discourage using it for clearnet browsing. Hosting and browsing onion services is fine.
> - You will need to connect with people on platforms like Signal or Telegram, where you need to use a phone number to register. Services like https://hstock.org and https://sms-activate.org do help a lot. If you use yours and police request your data, you are fucked.
> - Do not expect services to encrypt your data, do it yourself. E2EE is a fairytale unless you actually set it up.
>
> Get cryptocurrency in an anonymous way, and start using it!

I feel something romantic about this level of paranoia.
Luckily, neiter I nor anyone I've ever met had to apply any of these technics.
