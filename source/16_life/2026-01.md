`Jan 15, 2026` - I've been using Sentry for almost all of my carreer, but yesterday I received an email about Sentry asking for write permissions to my repos to create pull requests made by an LLM.
I didn't enjoy overall enshittification of Sentry interface over the past few years.
But this is it. That's the last drop. I'm looking for a replacement.
Preferrably something self-hosted with a low CPU/RAM usage.

`Jan 12, 2026` - It's been almost eleven years since the creation of "[PEP 492](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) – Coroutines with async and await syntax" by Yury Selivanov.
I've been writing asynchronous Python on and off for about a decade, and still, async/await is the most complex part of Python for me.
Recently, I wrote a synchronous generator that yields results from an asynchronous iterable. What a ride!
Back in the days of the PEP 492, Yury was working on EdgeDB, a wrapper layer around PostgreSQL.
In a way, he still is, but it's called [Gel](https://www.geldata.com), and is a part of Vercel (but the page title still says EdgeDB, lol).

Let's see what the people working on PEP 492 are up to:
- [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) - the creator and benevolent dictator of Python. Retired from Dropbox in 2019, just to join Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer in 2020.
- [Victor Stinner](https://vstinner.readthedocs.io) - one of the performance-focused Python core contributors. These days, his good work is paid for by IBM through Red Hat.
- [Elvis Pranskevichus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elprans/) - Yury's buddy, working with him in Vercel.
- [Andrew Svetlov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-svetlov/) - aiohttp maintainer, works as a VP of Engineering at Apolo.US, which at first glance looks the same as a hundred other AI startups.
- [Łukasz Langa](https://lukasz.langa.pl) - ex-Facebook core Python developer, author of Black, and release manager. Moved to a mid-sized Polish town, and doesn't show up much.
- [Greg Ewing](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/) - the winner of the ugliest homepage award.
- [Stephen J. Turnbull](https://gitlab.com/yaseppochi) - seemingly, a Mailman (The GNU Mailing List manager) maintainer.
- [Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca) - Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft in Canada and Python core developer.
- [Alyssa Coghlan](https://www.curiousefficiency.org) - Nicholas, at the time of the PEP, CPython core and packaging developer, supported by an Australian bank. Surprisingly, not working on `uv`.

The rest of the people I never heard about:
- [Paul Moore](https://github.com/pfmoore) - core developer of Python and pip.
- [Nathaniel Smith](https://vorpus.org/) - a scientist, doing science stuff, but somehow deep in the Python community.
- [Stefan Behnel](https://www.behnel.de/) - core developer of Python, maintainer of Cython and lxml.
- [Paul Sokolovsky](https://github.com/pfalcon) - author of a minimalistic Python dialect and a web framework written in that dialect.
- [Victor Petrovykh](https://github.com/vpetrovykh) - another member of the EdgeDB mafia.
- Steven D’Aprano - the only guy who got [suspended](https://discuss.python.org/t/suspending-a-core-developer-for-conduct-issues/25278) from being a Core Developer for public misconduct.
- Ethan Furman
- Jim J. Jewett

`Jan 12, 2026` - I got curious if smartphone notifications can be possibly implemented in a privacy-preserving fashion (and to what extent).

`Jan 10, 2026` - Going through my old GitHub stars, I rediscovered [Shibuya](https://shibuya.lepture.com/) theme, courtesy of [Hsiaoming Yang](https://lepture.com/).
The main reason to switch is pydata theme shipping 1.4 MB of fontawesome for no good reason.
Also, I love how minimal the theme looks, leaving more space for the content.
I wish it [supported Solarized color scheme](https://github.com/lepture/shibuya/issues/105).

`Jan 10, 2026` - [scottrogowski/code2flow](https://github.com/scottrogowski/code2flow) - Pretty good call graphs for dynamic languages

`Jan 09, 2026` - Mildly interesting idea: use GitHub CLI to export repos I starred and inject this information into my public journal.

```bash
gh api --paginate users/peterdemin/starred --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.star+json' | jq . > gh-stars.json
```

`Jan 09, 2026` - Here's some food for thought.
We got some nice green seedless grapes from Costco, but they were super tart.
If you let unripe grapes sit on a dark shelf for a couple of days, they'll get sweeter.
But they won't get more callories, because of the laws of conservation.
The grape is sealed and its carbohydrates don't go anywhere.
But my mind tricks me into thinking that sweet food provides more energy.

`Jan 03, 2026` - After watching Mr. Robot I got curious about IPFS in general and Anna's Archive in particular.
I found this [gem](https://software.annas-archive.li/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/issues/305) in Anna's Archive Git repo:

> Here is an extreme case for most, but very real for Anna's Archive, Libgen or Z-Library operators.
>
> - If you are under heavy police pressure from a surveillance government like the US, you are better off using a Live USB and a VPN with killswitch enabled when connecting to your server(s), avoid DNS leaks to Google or your ISP, and so on.
> - Consider using a disposable device for it. Canvas fingerprinting is a real thing.
> - Consider using a disposable disk for it and be prepared to dump it away. Disk forensics is also a thing.
> - Proton suite is unsafe and a honeypot, please do not use it. Tuta is a much better option.
> - Tor is slow, overhyped, flagged by tons of web firewalls, and not useful for pirating. Your traffic will stand out like a bright red light. I would strongly discourage using it for clearnet browsing. Hosting and browsing onion services is fine.
> - You will need to connect with people on platforms like Signal or Telegram, where you need to use a phone number to register. Services like https://hstock.org and https://sms-activate.org do help a lot. If you use yours and police request your data, you are fucked.
> - Do not expect services to encrypt your data, do it yourself. E2EE is a fairytale unless you actually set it up.
>
> Get cryptocurrency in an anonymous way, and start using it!

I feel something romantic about this level of paranoia.
Luckily, neiter I nor anyone I've ever met had to apply any of these technics.
