`Dec 27, 2025` - Inspired by [Clan](https://clan.lol/) and other Nix stories, I attempted to migrate my silly Vagrant+VirtualBox home setup to Terraform+KVM. I'm not very familiar with either, so I thought that's gonna be a fun learning experience. In a way, it was, but I learned not what I was hoping to.
I started at Medium's article [Vagrant and VirtualBox Are No Longer Enough: Why KVM and Terraform Are the Future of DevOps](https://medium.com/@mohrezfadaei/vagrant-and-virtualbox-are-no-longer-enough-why-kvm-and-terraform-are-the-future-of-devops-24f978c9ca2c). AI-generated illustration was the first sign, but I ignored it. Looking at the article now, it's obvious to me now, that it's an AI slop through and through. Fuck you, [Mohammad Reza Fadaei](https://medium.com/@mohrezfadaei), you lazy piece of shit.

The first challenge came from Terraform provider for libvirtd being not an "official" Hashicorp thing, but a "learning platform" for a random stranger (No offense, [Duncan Mac-Vicar P.](https://www.mac-vicar.eu/), thanks for doing what you're doing).

The second challenge was that the Duncan's provider got a major rewrite and all Terraform recipes from the tutorial had to be migrated.

The third challenge was that Ubuntu 22.04 has some weird issue in libvirt apparmor configuraion. Apparently, a VM doesn't get permissions to any of the volumes created specifically for it. There should be a script that generates a list of volume paths somewhere, but who knows what happened to it.

After 3 hours of battling every part of the "Future of DevOps", my ChatGPT browser tab started to run out of memory, and I gave up.
Looking back, I love how simple my Vagrant setup is, and I want to extend my gratitude to [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) for building it.
I still want to make my silly home VM work without dependency on any external dependencies (except stable Ubuntu/Debian repo), so if I get more time for this project, I'll try vibing raw libvirt config.

`Dec 21, 2025` - While reading "Material World" by Ed Conway, I many times thought about Oxygen Not Included, which is a cartoonistic survival game about a settlement deep underground. Being deep means they don't get free solar and wind power, no access to virtually unlimited fresh water, and, as the title suggests, no oxygen. Such hermetic setup forces player into constant mining of resources (they made up oxylite, a stone that produces oxygen). As population grows, you need more and more resources, that progressively become hard to get. Fun game, totally recommend.
Another thought, that I keep coming back to again and again after finishing the book, is that even farming depends on fossil fuels. Sometimes in mass media you can get an idea, that global warming and rising CO2 levels are due to the greed of filthy crude oil oligarhs. But the we need fossil fuels to produce fertilisers, without which it would be impossible to grow enough food to feed the evergrowing population of Earth. Building a single windmill power generator requires vast amounts of concrete and steel, producing which takes about a year worth of eletricity that windmill generates.
It's a great book, and I totally recommend it as well.
