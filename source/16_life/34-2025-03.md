`Mar 28, 2025` - Imaging having to learn jQuery in 2025. How does it make you feel?

`Mar 21, 2025` - In the meantime, in the LG headquarters:
- How's our extended reality department performing?
- Ah, not great. The market doesn't grow as much as we thought.
- I see. What about air conditioning?
- What about it?
- Is it good?
- Yeah, HVAC is great, no problems there.
- Okay, let's do that instead.
- Instead of XR?
- Yeah, screw it. The future is in HVAC. Really promising direction.
- Sure, I'll dissolve the XR department by the end of week.

`Mar 15, 2025` - In times when the life feels like too much, I remind myself of the words of my high school literature teacher.
When hearing complaints from the students about how big the home assignments are and how they don't have enough time to prepare for all the subjects, she always said: "You'll take rest in afterlife."
For some students it sounded harsh, for other like a joke, but for all not much of an actionable advice.
It took me many years to understand that the idea is sound.
The life stops when you lay down in the coffin.
Until then, the purpose of life is to live it.
The more you do, the more capable you become of doing more.
On the other hand, the mind at rest weakens rapidly.
Humans adapt to good fast, and from the body's perspective concerving energy is good.
Optimizing for minimum effort to get maximum pleasure.
Which is in contrast with a notion of productive life.
One has push themselves out of the comfort zone to achieve the greatness.
Taking rest is a step back rather then a mere pause.


`Mar 14, 2025` - Reading [CTO Handbook](https://zachgoldberg.com/ctohandbook/) made me realize, that if I had a great startup idea and the right people around me, I would do things that I've never done before, many of which I deliberately chose not to do. I would also do a few nice things, but mostly the other kind.

`Mar 14, 2025` -
Some people, aspire for greater things, and manage to build their way to the goal.
Other people are happy with what they got, maybe incrementally improve situation over time, or stay in the same place and enjoy themselves.
And some people say: "Oh, if I had this and that, I would achieve great things, build something amazing."
Naturally, they never do, because that would put them in the first group.
I'd say this is some kind of a mental block, that doesn't let them to join one of the other groups.
It makes them pathologically unhappy, leading them to put the blame on external forces, government, society, status, people, anything except for their own mindset.
People who are messed up in the head and capable of action belong in the nuthouse.
Messed up in the head but incapable of action - society burden. 
This is not a person's property, it only applies to some aspects and only within some timeframe.

`Mar 05, 2025` - Something extremely important if you want to make a point. And absolutely insignificant for all other purposes. "Technicality".

`Mar 03, 2025` - A week-long vacation definitely helps with the unexplainable dreadful feelings.
The best (and only) solution to work-related stress is to not work.

`Mar 03, 2025` - I think Sean Goedecke is onto something in his post "[Knowing where your engineer salary comes from](https://www.seangoedecke.com/where-the-money-comes-from/)".
While the post is inline with his recurring cornerstone of a mature-pragmattic-staff-engineer, he touches on a topic of different lenses to look onto a software project.
Engineers focus on problem complexity (and solution simplicity), performance, architecture and whatnot.
The bridge to business people is effort estimate in man hours.
Which translates roughly to costs of implementation.
That business people use to weight against the projected profits over the lifetime of the project (in years).
Also, weighted against the potential return from other projects that team can do instead.

I've never seen profits enter the picture for engineering planning, os it's often a kind of a dark area, of why is the deadline needs to be at this particular date.

`Mar 01, 2025` - Some questions should never be asked because they won't be answered.
Not because the answer is unknown, but because it's not in the person's interest to provide an honest one.
This comes up a lot for opinion seeking.
Person's opinion about the topic influences other people's opinion about this person.
If a candidate is not super enthused about a company, they don't get a job.
If project manager says that their project is not the best opportunity of a lifetime and super bomb that changes everything, they will be in trouble.
So you can't ask them. Because their hands are tied. Their opinion belongs to their superiors, or public.
Even you ask someone, what do they think of you, you're not going to get an honest opinion.
Because any negativity in the opinion may backfire in the future.
So, here we are, in a bright shiny world, where everyone is super happy about everyone else.
Except that half of marrieages end in divorce, people get laid of every year, and 90% of startups fail.
