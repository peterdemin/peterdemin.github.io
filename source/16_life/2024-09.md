`Sep 23, 2024` - What if engineering strategy, performance reviews, and code quality metrics were connected?

- The engineering strategy spells out what engineering goals are.
- Performance review questions address those aspects directly.
- Continuous Integration measures and tracks the project metrics towards the goals.
- Self-review is just a biannual export from the CI.

Beautiful utopia.

`Sep 21, 2024` - This is good: [The Collapse of Self-Worth in the Digital Age](https://thewalrus.ca/collapse-of-self-worth-in-the-digital-age/). The part that resonated with me most:

> when a person's innate value is replaced with exchange value, it is as if we've been reduced to "a mere jelly."

I remember the times where I put maximum effort and long hours over more than a year to achieve the next invidividual contributer level.
Eventually, with the project success, I got it.
My level became IC5, as opposed to the measly IC4.
Then I got some form of a depression.
Because my whole self-worth was reduced to number 5 by the authority, that I put most of my waking hours in.

`Sep 02, 2024` - Someone told once a theory that the most comfortable bed wouldn't the softest one.
It would be a bed that perfectly follows your body shape and provides equal support everywhere.
That makes sense to me.
You can go to a beach, lie in sand a wiggle a bit, until you shape up the sand around your body.
But there're always many distractions, like sun, wind, noise, and insects, eww.
Or maybe the sensory deprivation tank, where you float in dense salty water in complete silence and darkness.
I'm not sure how would it work with turning around, or involuntary movements during the sleep.
Mark Rober made a [Liquid Sand Hot Tub video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs) where he explains the sensation of being submerged under sand, as a weighted blanket.
The sand is pretty irritating for a sleep, though.
Hygiene of using sand pit as long-term bed is also questionable.
