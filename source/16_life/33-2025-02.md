`Feb 14, 2025` - TIL Talos Group of Cisco has 64 open-source repos on GitHub: https://github.com/Cisco-Talos.
Most prominent is [ClamAV](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav) - the [only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_antivirus_software) open source anti-virus toolkit.
Of course it wasn't originated inside of Cisco.
And it wasn't even the first acquisition.
And Talos Group is kinda independent company under Cisco umbrella (based in Maryland, by the way).
But still, I find this to be a cool piece of trivia.

`Feb 13, 2025` - Sad [resignation letter](https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/) from Asahi Linux maintainer.
I've never used or heard about Asahi Linux before.
Or never cared about running Linux on Apple hardware, since MacOS is close enough to Linux for my uses.
But the letter clicked with me of a few topics.

One is, [hell is other people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Is_Other_People), including OSS.
I love open-source, and most of my hobby projects are public.
But not many of them see much external contribution.
The most joy I get is when I'm heads-down working on them, not when I try to align with strangers.

Another is [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law):

> [O]rganizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

I see open-source as a great organizational structure to run software projects.
But it's still prone to the problems, that any human community has.
I still wonder, though, can open-source projects governance be tweaked in ways, to solve it?..

`Feb 13, 2025` - This is gold:

> [Rational ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the supposed cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the expected potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.

I've done it to so many topics, and had hard time explaining why exactly even to myself.
Religion, politics, Android development, serverless, etc.
So many things where I see the low value without having putting 1% effort into study.
Of course, there are things that I ignore out of laziness and arrogance as well. But that's off-topic.

`Feb 12, 2025` - The topic that comes up from time to time is how frustrating the visa/greencard situation is.
People wait for years or decades for a process that's purpose is to wait.
The system is run by people who are citizens and have no empathy to the people who are their customers.
In fact, I don't think they're considering their applicants as customers at all.
The system is a poorly masked adversarial filter.

Another adversarial filter I and many people in my social circle interact with a lot is technical interviews for software engineers.
I'm not gonna say anything new regarding how frustrating and annoying the common process is.
What's interesting, though, is that being on the other side, interviewing other people, I get zero motivation to tweak the process to get feedback.
