`Nov 18, 2024` - I get this feeling in the morning, that I need to make the last push and get it done.
And it's confusing, because there's no finish line.
No matter what gets done, the life goes on, and it packs more of the same.
Maybe it's a natural desire to accomplish something, to achieve a goal.
The problem is that there's no single goal, a lot of things happen in parallel.
Something starts, something finishes, and some things just die off.

The hypothetical situation of where you land in a position, where all the hard stuff is behind.
You can relax and just enjoy yourself.

1. War never changes.
2. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

4. Those who are reluctant to feed their own army shall feed a foreign army.
