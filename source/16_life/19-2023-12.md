`Dec 22, 2023` - so, I have this idea, that I can’t articulate properly for years. It’s like with Ikea furniture, that seems bland and minimalistic. It doesn’t express any style or beauty, it’s functional and that’s it. Another example is people who focus their self expression in the way they look. Be it some special hair style, choice of clothes, or tattoos. Contrary to people who look bland, maybe simple. But express their selves in their thoughts. It feels like people who spend their time on their looks trade it for having something worthy in their heads. The parallel with the furniture is that you can make your prefab functional furniture truly yours and personal with DIY decoration, and you can spend good times wondering your mind, as opposed to going to hair stylist, or picking a tattoo that matches your personality. 
I guess, what I’m trying to say your self expression is not for showing off someone else’s craft, it’s for you alone and small circle of people who matter to you. 

`Dec 09, 2023` - okay, let me teach you how to read. You sit in an armchair, put your glasses and beard on. You must sit very still for a long time and look the smartest you can.

`Dec 06, 2023` - ADHD test for adults: pay attention spectating 2-hour Scrum planning meeting in a new team.

`Dec 02, 2023` - I'm brewing on these topics:
- [Sailor, a tiny PaaS](https://github.com/mardix/sailor)
- [Micro-DevOps With Systemd](https://hackernoon.com/micro-devops-with-systemd-supercharge-any-ordinary-linux-server)
- [Systemd Without Root](https://sekor.eu.org/techlog/systemd-without-root-instances/)

Sailor is nice, it combines:
- Git-push-driven deployments
- Dynamic nginx configuration
- Letsencrypt auto-provisioning
- uWSGI Emperor mode as a generic supervisor

My use case is a bit different.
I'm looking into adding Tailscale, dropping SSL, and replacing uWSGI with systemd.
Also, I might look into replacing nginx with Caddy.
I also want a cleaner Python virtualenv management.

What encourages me most is that Sailor is a single Python file of 2k lines.
