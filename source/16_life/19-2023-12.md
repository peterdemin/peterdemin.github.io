`Dec 02, 2023` - I'm brewing on these topics:
- [Sailor, a tiny PaaS](https://github.com/mardix/sailor)
- [Micro-DevOps With Systemd](https://hackernoon.com/micro-devops-with-systemd-supercharge-any-ordinary-linux-server)
- [Systemd Without Root](https://sekor.eu.org/techlog/systemd-without-root-instances/)

Sailor is nice, it combines:
- Git-push-driven deployments
- Dynamic nginx configuration
- Letsencrypt auto-provisioning
- uWSGI Emperor mode as a generic supervisor

My use case is a bit different.
I'm looking into adding Tailscale, dropping SSL, and replacing uWSGI with systemd.
Also, I might look into replacing nginx with Caddy.
I also want a cleaner Python virtualenv management.

What encourages me most is that Sailor is a single Python file of 2k lines.
