And here's a new addition, that I find more interesting:

👾 (space invader) means "Maybe" because maybe aliens exist.

`Oct 09, 2025` - László Krasznahorkai won the 2025 Nobel prize in literature.
I've never heard about this author, and never bothered with Nobel prize winners before.
But this time I thought I take a look.
The award is honoring Krasznahorkai "for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art."
You don't find visionary oeuvre lying around every day, so I had to check, and it means "a book" in this case.
Somewhat devour feculence moment for me.

Here's an excerpt from NPR:

> Satantango, Krasznahorkai's first novel, came out in 1985. It's about a pair of swindlers and a nearly abandoned collective farm. The book was made into a seven-hour movie in 1994. And The Melancholy of Resistance, which is one sentence that runs over 300 pages, is about a strange, ghostly circus appearing in a small town with a giant, dead stuffed whale.

Wow, wow, wow, hold on, what? Okay, I guess, that clarifies a couple moments for me. Mainly, should I ever check again on Nobel prize winners in literature.
