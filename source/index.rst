ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Peter
================

I develop Python services for `Moveworks <https://moveworks.ai>`_ in United States.

Previously I lived in Russia and Belarus working for Yandex and EPAM in the same position.

I write about Python, vim and git.
Iâ€™m trying to keep a :ref:`public journal <life>` about non-technical topics.
