Build up your job severance with monthly payments.

## How it works

You pay $19 per month. If you get fired or laid off, we pay you $2,000.
If you choose to pay $49 per month, the payout grows to $5,000. Pay $99, collect $10,000. 

The payout amount is progressive. It starts at zero and grows every month by ten times your monthly payment. 
For example, on day one you paid $19.  After the first month, the coverage becomes $190. Second month, you put $19 more, now the coverage becomes $380. And so on, until 11 month later, you achieve $2,000 coverage, at which point the amount is fixed. 
The same goes for the higher tiers, that allow you to grow the payout above $2,000 up to $10,000.
