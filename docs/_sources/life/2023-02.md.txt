`February 1, 2023` Â· Davit and I have been working on https://paydayprotection.com for about a week in total. So far we got a landing page to collect emails of the people who will early access to the service once we launch it.
Building it is fun. I learned 11ty and tailwind, refreshed my CSS. The whole thing is deployed to Netlify and uses Netlify Forms and Functions to save the submitted emails. So far we are well into the free tier.
Many parts of the site are generated by, or with help, of ChatGPT and other AI services. Their output is grammatically correct, but dull and soulless, which doesn't work well with marketing we're looking for.
We gonna have a professional designer work on the page, and give us mock ups, that I should be able to quickly enact through the 11ty+tailwind boilerplate I built.

I started reading "Start small, stay small: a developer's guide to launching a startup" by Rob Walling. The book is exciting and straight to the point. I already can see how much our effort is misplaced.

We need to work on our goals, and really figure out the marketing effort, and how we can validate the idea.
