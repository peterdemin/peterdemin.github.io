I want to experiment with hosting .deb (.rpm?) packages on GitHub pages.

So far, I found these two tutorials:
* https://assafmo.github.io/2019/05/02/ppa-repo-hosted-on-github.html
* https://pmateusz.github.io/linux/2017/06/30/linux-secure-apt-repository.html

Would be nice to automate the index update and GPG signing through GitHub Actions.

Packages, that I'm most interested in hosting:
* Kibitzr
* Arr family: Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr.

Both individuals and the larger society have agreed to a set of interlocking delicate systems that are simultaneously highly effective and spectacularly vulnerable to disruption.

`May 17, 2022` · Notes on stress management. 

Stress management is management of body and mind. Stress is an integral part of human biology. Without stress hormones we would simple die. 

1. Survival kit: sleep, eat, exercise. 
2. Sleep: 7-9 hours a day. Consistent schedule for work days and weekend. Reduce screen time before sleep. Keep phone outside of bedroom. 
3. Food: three colors of vegetables and fruits. 3 meals a day. Standard servings - no overeating. 
4. Exercise: stretch every now and then. Brisk walks for 30 minutes. 
5. Don’t need to start doing everything at once. Build good habits one step at a time. Lifestyle change feels like a hard work. 
6. Avoid quick fixes: pills, drinks, energy bars, phone apps, gadgets, books, movies. Those only increase the number of things to keep track of. And the relief is only temporary.
7. Write down the goals, not just say it. 
8. Note what causes stress, make a list of situations. 
9. Practice simple meditation several times a day. Focus on breath and do a body scan. 
10. Relax muscles while sitting, one group at a time. Neck, shoulders, arms, back, legs and feet.
11. Hang out with friends to feel social connection.

`May 10, 2022` · I just tried to explain gender transformation to my kids in popular Soviet song:

> Я был когда-то странной игрушкой безымянной.

Protagonist is a male (animal), but he was a toy in the past.
But toy's gender is feminine.
Which makes a weird mix of two genders in one sentence separated by the time.

The opposite example blew their minds:

> Я была когда-то странным утюгом безымянным.

Here are some of my favorite quotes from songs.
I catch myself reciting this one during tough debug sessions:

    Goddamn machinery
    Why don't you speak to me?
        -- "The Axe" by Thom Yorke


And this I love for the structure of the sentence:

    When I am king
    You will be first against the wall
    With your opinion
    Which is of no consequence at all
        -- "Paranoid Android" by Radiohead


This one is for "broken pipe" and "Socket closed":

    Communication breakdown, it's always the same
    Havin' a nervous breakdown, a-drive me insane
        -- "Communication Breakdown" by Led Zeppelin

TIL that US schools close in observance of the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr, a festive celebration marking the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide.
But they call it Quarterly grading/planning. Maybe to not stir the masses.
