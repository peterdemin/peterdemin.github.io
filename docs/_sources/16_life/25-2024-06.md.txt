Fat cat lives a lavish life, with all needs and desires satisfied.
The cat is incapable of surviving on his own, though.

In order to maintain agility he has to sacrifise the comfort, and intentionally lower the quality of life.
If he settles for too long, the fat will bloat the body and kill the cat with a heart attack.
