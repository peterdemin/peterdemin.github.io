#!/bin/sh
iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner deluge -j MARK --set-mark 42
iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.1/24 -m owner --uid-owner deluge -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
ip rule add fwmark 42 table 42

for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do
    echo 0 > $f
    done;

# ip route add default via $(ifconfig -a tun0 | grep -o 'P-t-P:[^ ]*' | cut -d : -f 2) table 42
ip route add default via $(ifconfig -a tun0 | grep -o 'destination [^ ]*' | awk '{print $2}') table 42
```
