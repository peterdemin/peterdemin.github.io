`Aug 10, 2023` - Notes for [Scaling the Practice of Architecture, Conversationally](https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html):
**Problem:**
- Article starts at the situation where there exists a small group of architects, that are a bottleneck to decision process.
- Additionaly, the existing process involves a handoff between the architect drawing abstract diagrams, and an engineer implementing the design.
- The organization structure contradicts a simple truth:
  architecture in the heads of those writing the code, that is the most important.
  As Alberto Brandolini said: "It is the developer's assumptions which get shipped to production".

**Solution:**
- Introduce the Advice Process: anyone can make an architectural decision, but they must follow the process. In essense they create a document of a particular structure, outlining the proposition, and seek an advice from affected parties.
- Affected parties for each aspect of the decision making are documented as a checklist: this person for security, this for UX, that for analytics, etc.
- The Process consists of four parts:
  1. A thinking and recording tool;
  2. A time and place for conversations;
  3. A light to illuminate and guide towards a unified direction (Team-sourced Architectural Principles);
  4. A means to sense the current technical landscape and climate.
- They must document the advices received, and explore the alternatives, documenting them meticulously in the same doc.
- They don't need to actually follow each advice, and the chosen solution can contradict them.
- Org holds weekly, hour-long Architecture Advisory Forum ("AAF") primarily to seek and give advice in public, so the *architectural principles* dissiminate through the company.
- AAF is not the only place to seek advice. In the early stage of ADR, 1-1s are more efficient and allow building up a solid ADR for a quicker AAF meeting. On the other hand, AAF meeting can result in follow-up 1-1s to explore the alternatives deeper.
- Teams explicitly flag in their ADRs is not just the principles which apply, but also when their decision conflicts with one or more principles.
- (Then article went on to explaining the mechanics and benefits of running an in-house tech radar.
  That didn't resonate with me, maybe I'll revisit it later.)

**Pitfals:**
- Architectural failures are integral part of the decision making.
  The team feels safe to re-visit, and share the learnings.
  It embraces them, calling them out specifically and celebrating them in the AAF.
  This is a key aspect of building a learning culture.
- Some decisions never make it to ADR and AAF for many good reasons.
  When this happens, it's important to treat is as a learning opportunity, instead of falling back to old ways and taking control.
- Team (?) makes sure influence is balanced and not based on reputation, tenure or place in the hierarchy.
  Making sure quieter contributors are heard.

**Conclusion:**
- Advice Process is not looking for consensus, but for a broad range of inputs and voices.

`Aug 9, 2023` - Notes for ["Decentralizing the Practice of Architecture at Xapo Bank"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/xapo-architecture-experience.html):
- Company had horizontal teams, separating architects from engineers.
- This caused big number of handoffs and slow/broken feedback loops.
- They changed the org structure to vertical teams aligned with the core products.
- They implemented few processes targeting faster decision making and broader knowledge sharing.  Namely: 
    - Architecture Decision Records (ADR).
    - Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
    - Architecture Advisory Forum (AAF) and Architectural Advice Process (AAP).
- They used ticket tracker (Jira) to host ADRs and measure their progress through statuses: drafted, proposed, accepted, and adopted.
- ADRs linked to development stories and tasks.
- They allowed decisions to be taken without consensus.
- They provided a safe environment to make mistakes and re-evaluate past decisions.
