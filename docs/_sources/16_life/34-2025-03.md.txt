`Mar 03, 2025` - I think Sean Goedecke is onto something in his post "[Knowing where your engineer salary comes from](https://www.seangoedecke.com/where-the-money-comes-from/)".
While the post is inline with his recurring cornerstone of a mature-pragmattic-staff-engineer, he touches on a topic of different lenses to look onto a software project.
Engineers focus on problem complexity (and solution simplicity), performance, architecture and whatnot.
The bridge to business people is effort estimate in man hours.
Which translates roughly to costs of implementation.
That business people use to weight against the projected profits over the lifetime of the project (in years).
Also, weighted against the potential return from other projects that team can do instead.

I've never seen profits enter the picture for engineering planning, os it's often a kind of a dark area, of why is the deadline needs to be at this particular date.

`Mar 01, 2025` - Some questions should never be asked because they won't be answered.
Not because the answer is unknown, but because it's not in the person's interest to provide an honest one.
This comes up a lot for opinion seeking.
Person's opinion about the topic influences other people's opinion about this person.
If a candidate is not super enthused about a company, they don't get a job.
If project manager says that their project is not the best opportunity of a lifetime and super bomb that changes everything, they will be in trouble.
So you can't ask them. Because their hands are tied. Their opinion belongs to their superiors, or public.
Even you ask someone, what do they think of you, you're not going to get an honest opinion.
Because any negativity in the opinion may backfire in the future.
So, here we are, in a bright shiny world, where everyone is super happy about everyone else.
Except that half of marrieages end in divorce, people get laid of every year, and 90% of startups fail.
