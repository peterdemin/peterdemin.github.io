`Apr 02, 2025` - TIL about [Happy Eyeballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs) - the weirdest name for trying to connect to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses simultaneously to reduce the request time in case one of them is not accessible.
They call it an "algorithm", and it has dedicated libraries, like [aiohappyeyeballs](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohappyeyeballs) 👏
