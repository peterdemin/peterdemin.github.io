`Dec 10, 2024` - Existential crysis minute. Metaphor mode.

1. A stock chart, jumping up and down every minute. Every move is a strict sum of asks and bids executed in order. And yet the stock value can't be predicted even 1 second ahead.
2. A man running in a forest jumping over falling trees and ducking under branches. Except that the forest is dark the man can't see anything. Sometimes he guesses right, sometimes he hits the branch, falls, gets up and keeps running. The position of every tree and branch is predetermined and exact for each moment in time, and yet, unknown to the man.
3. An incomprehensible complex multidimensional visualization of a microorganism cell state with exact number of molecules, atoms, and electrons.
4. The same visualization but for each moment of its life.
5. The same visualization but for a person.
6. The same visualization but for all of humanity.
7. A simplified version of it, showing just one aspect as a black curve on a flat white sheet of paper.
8. A coin scratching a layer of paint off the single line chart. Revealing the essence of life progression on Earth.
9. A bar chart showing amount of energy consumed by a person each day of his life.
10. Another bar chart for sum value of all material exchanges.
11. Another, for the value of immaterial exchanges.
12. A bend of a line representing a total net value of a particular life year-by-year.
13. A point at which the line crosses zero.
14. A quick flash in the infinite history of the universe that had humanity.
15. A short stretch of timeline labeled "carbon-based life".

`Dec 09, 2024` - TIL that Listerine mouthwash is bad for teeth. Because it's acidic, duh. I've been using it for years, looking at the self-ad of killing 99.9% of germs, and not considering the pH. There's non-acidic mouth washes, like Act, that don't have this problem.

`Dec 06, 2024` - Does it sound harsh to you if I say that half of the US population has IQ below average?
