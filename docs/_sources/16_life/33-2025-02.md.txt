`Feb 12, 2025` - The topic that comes up from time to time is how frustrating the visa/greencard situation is.
People wait for years or decades for a process that's purpose is to wait.
The system is run by people who are citizens and have no empathy to the people who are their customers.
In fact, I don't think they're considering their applicants as customers at all.
The system is a poorly masked adversarial filter.

Another adversarial filter I and many people in my social circle interact with a lot is technical interviews for software engineers.
I'm not gonna say anything new regarding how frustrating and annoying the common process is.
What's interesting, though, is that being on the other side, interviewing other people, I get zero motivation to tweak the process to get feedback.
