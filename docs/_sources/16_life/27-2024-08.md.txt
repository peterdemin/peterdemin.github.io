`Aug 23, 2024` - A rare syndrome of unprepared food censorship

`Aug 18, 2024` - this tea bag summarizes my thoughts of food in the US. The brown dust resembles tea only in color. But thatâ€™s what Americans like. No sophistication, big quantities, low price.

`Aug 07, 2024` - I was watching [Expanse](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) and was fascinated by their handheld devices (phones?).
I liked the way they wirelessly cast screen using two-fingers swipe up in the direction of the cast target.
I also liked how they share message attachments.
The operating systems they are running seem to provide consistent experience across devices, so I assume there's a tight integration.
What I liked most is that attachments contained two kinds formats.
One was a presentation layer, similar to a static HTML page.
Another was data (like JSON, or CSV) that can be direcly imported to a database or Jupyter Notebook.
Like one time a person sent a bunch of people profiles, and the other side reviewed them and imported to their contacts.
Another time it was asteroid coordinates, that were presented as an interactive 3D model, but also could be imported into the navigational system.

I wonder if we can build this today.
Each attachment would be an archive with HTML file that pulls raw data from a JSON file sitting by its side.
But also having a "Download" button that exposes the data file directly.
Or maybe a single HTML file with all the small data and assets embedded, and large assets pulled from S3.

`Aug 01, 2024` - I find this to be an interesting phenomena in driving.
When there are two lanes and there's a merge ahead from the right lane.
In the perfect world the merge is fair, the cars from the left and right lane alternate and both lanes go at the same speed.But what happens instead is some cars from the right lane merge early breaking the alternation order.
Then the car from behind in the right lane goes ahead and merges before the early merger.
And this breaks the pattern so that some cars from the right lane get into the left lane without a car between them.
The result is that the right lane goes faster.
