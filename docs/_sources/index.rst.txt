ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Peter
================

I live in the US and work as a Senior Software Engineer. 
Previously, I lived in Russia and Belarus, working for Yandex and EPAM in the same position.

I write about Python, vim, git, and software engineering in general.
Iâ€™m trying to keep a :ref:`public journal <life>` about non-technical topics.
