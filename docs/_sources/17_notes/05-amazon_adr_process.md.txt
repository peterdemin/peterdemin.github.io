# Amazon ADR process

Article: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html>

## Notes

- Amazon implements ADRs without AAF in a strictier setup.
- Anyone can start an ADR.
- ADR can have several authors, who maintain and communicate the ADR content. They are called "owners".
- Everyone can contribute to the ADR. All changes must be approved by the owner.
- ADR goes through a review with a team. During review, the ADR can be accepted, rejected, or get new work assigned.
- ADR requires at least one approval to get accepted.
- Once accepted or rejected, ADR is immutable. All changes require a new ADR.
- Project owner seems to have a deciding voice in the process.

## Conclusion

Amazon implements ADR in a more bureaucratic way. Instead of seeking advice, the author seeks an approval.
The ADR is reviewed by the team, instead of a cross-functional group of stakeholders.
