# Sociocracy 3.0

Article: <https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/index.html>

## Notes

- 3 guys wrapped Agile and other modern frameworks and called it Sociocracy 3.0
- They go to a great length to sell their ideas before getting to the meat of it.
- Reading through principles I felt like I read this all many times before.

## Conclusion

- Most of it is hype and common sense.
- Maybe good for someone new to the field to have all these ideas in one place.
- More experienced people are not likely to find anything useful.
