## Notes

- Clarify your manager’s expectations: what, why, when, and who.
- When approaching a colleage:
    - Share the requirements.
    - Ask for required steps, and estimates.
    - Ask what else is on their plate, and how this task fits within their priorities.
    - Share the stakes: communicate the importance, where it fits in with other initiatives, how it affects stakeholders, and the ramifications if you cannot deliver.
    - If the person is on another team, have their manager and yours present.
    - Set up a tracker. Document the plan, milestones, and deadlines. Configure automatic reminders instead of nagging personally.
    - Set up recurring meeting to share emerging challenges.
    - Express gratitude that the person is sharing their concerns rather than showing frustration.
    - If possible, remove the roadblocks, otherwise escalate them to the manager.
    - When escalating don't handoff the accountability. Instead, ask for advice and coaching.
    - If the colleage falls behind on delivery, provide the feedback using the following structure:
        - Orient to the Situation: in the plan, you committed to having the code done on Tuesday.
        - Describe their Behavior: It’s Thursday, and you haven’t finished it yet.
        - Share the Impact: I’m getting worried that I’ll only have three days for quality testing.
        - Hand Over Accountability: What would it take to get this by the end of the day?
    - After delivery take time for reflection, build relationships, foster empathy and trust.
