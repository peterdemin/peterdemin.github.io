## Notes

- Key metrics:
  - **Deployment Frequency** — How often an organization successfully releases to production.
  - **Lead Time for Changes** — The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.
  - **Change Failure Rate** — The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.
  - **Time to Restore Service** — How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.
- The metrics describe infrastructure platform maturity.
  On-demand deployments with lead time under 1 hour, and failure rate under 15% of deployments is considered "Elite".
