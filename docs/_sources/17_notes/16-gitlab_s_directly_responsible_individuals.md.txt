# Gitlab's Directly Responsible Individuals

Article: <https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/>

## Notes

- DRI is accountable for the success or failure of that project.
- Everyone can give input.
- DRI makes a decision.
- DRI does not have to explain why they're making a decision, and they absolutely do not have to convince other people.
- DRI consults with all teams that have action items to ensure they have context and that actions are assigned.

## Conclusion

Gitlab process reminded me of [Architecture Advice Process](/17_notes/02_advice_process.md), but they never refer to it.
They might have something like ADR, but it's not called that way.
Overall, I think, it's a sensible adaption for an async work style.
