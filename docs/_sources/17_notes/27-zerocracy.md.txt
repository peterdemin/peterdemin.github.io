# Zerocracy

## Notes

- Zerocracy tries to automate and cancel out project management done by humans.
- It very quickly goes into a warzone of hunting bad behaviors.
- It targets high-churn outsourced teams, where you need to always keep an eye out for "cheaters".
- From the looks of it, the system achieves the goal of not doing manual project management.
- It also pulls the soul of out software engineering, and makes working more mechanical, and less "fun".
- Even then, I'd say it's better than having a shitty project manager (and 90% of them are).
- Working in less strict environment allows for the people to occasionally slack off.
- But also creates space for "labor of love" kind of a flow.
