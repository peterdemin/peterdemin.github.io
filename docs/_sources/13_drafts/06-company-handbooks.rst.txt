Definition
----------

From `Employee handbook -
Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_handbook>`__:

An **employee handbook**, sometimes also known as an employee manual,
staff handbook, or company policy manual, is a book given to employees
by an employer.

The employee handbook can be used to bring together employment and
job-related information which employees need to know. It typically has
three types of content:

#. Cultural: A welcome statement, the company's mission or purpose,
   company values, and more.
#. General Information: holiday arrangements, company perks, policies
   not required by law, policy summaries, and more.
#. Case-Specific: company policies, rules, disciplinary and grievance
   procedures, and other information modeled after employment laws or
   regulations.

The employee handbook, if one exists, is almost always a part of a
company's onboarding or induction process for new staff. A written
employee handbook gives clear advice to employees and creates a culture
where issues are dealt with fairly and consistently.

Conclusion
----------

Employee handbooks define processes and organizational topics that are
important, mostly to new hires. They don't cover the engineering design
of the product, projects, troubleshooting, or timelines. None of the
examples include operational information. Instead, they focus on
non-technical topics such as vision, strategy, culture, and so on. I'm
yet to find an example of a nice C4-like internal-focused eng
documentation in public access. I should explore these three projects
next:

#. Apache.
#. OpenStack.
#. SaltStack.
#. Sentry.
