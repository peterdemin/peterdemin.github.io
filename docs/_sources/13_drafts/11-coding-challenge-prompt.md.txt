Here's a Coding Challenge below, you will write a program to pass the given tests and the hidden tests.
Problem:

Most Unique Elements

Your goal is to find unlikely characters in a group of strings.

Given a list of strings, select the strings where the most common character has the smallest proportion in its string.

If multiple strings have the same proportion, select all the strings with the smallest proportion.

Return a new string composed of the characters that are only present in the selected strings.

    def solution(A, Y)

(ignore the 2nd parameter for this part)

Example: ["aba", "ab", "abbcdd"]

  - "aba": most common character is 'a', with proportion of 2/3

  - "ab": most common characters are 'a' and 'b' with proportion 1/2

  - "abbcdd": most common character are 'b' and 'd', with proportion of 2/6

The smallest proportion is 2/6, so we select the last string "abbcdd" and return the characters that are only present in this string: "cdd".

Your goal is to analyze the problem carefully and come up with a correct and efficient solution.
