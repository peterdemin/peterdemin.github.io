# Ignominious Python timezones

A good old timezone battle.

Here's the glitch. If your local timezone is US/Pacific (PST):

```
>>> from pytz import timezone
>>> TIMEZONE = timezone("America/Los_Angeles")

>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1).astimezone(TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-08:00'

>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tzinfo=TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-07:53'
```

Same code running with the local timezone set to UTC (like on a server):

```
>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1).astimezone(TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2024-12-31T16:00:00-08:00'

>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tzinfo=TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-07:53'
```

Python documentation on [astimezone](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.astimezone):

> `datetime.astimezone(tz=None)`
>
> Return a datetime object with new tzinfo attribute tz, adjusting the date and time data so the result is the same UTC time as self, but in tzâ€™s local time.
>
> If provided, tz must be an instance of a tzinfo subclass, and its utcoffset() and dst() methods must not return None.
> If self is naive, it is presumed to represent time in the system time zone.
>
> If called without arguments (or with tz=None) the system local time zone is assumed for the target time zone.
> The .tzinfo attribute of the converted datetime instance will be set to an instance of timezone with the zone name and offset obtained from the OS.
>
> If self.tzinfo is tz, self.astimezone(tz) is equal to self: no adjustment of date or time data is performed.
> Else the result is local time in the time zone tz, representing the same UTC time as self:
> after astz = dt.astimezone(tz), astz - astz.utcoffset() will have the same date and time data as dt - dt.utcoffset().
>
> If you merely want to attach a timezone object tz to a datetime dt

> If you merely want to remove the timezone object from an aware datetime dt

Let's apply this doc to the examples.
For the user device case, having local timezone set to PST,
`datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1)` is a naive datetime, having `self.tzinfo=None`,
no adjustment of date or time data is performed, because the target timezone is the same as local:

```
>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1).astimezone(TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-08:00'
```

Okay. when timezone is passed directly as tzinfo, we get the weird offset:

```
>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tzinfo=TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-07:53'
```

The reason is explained on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50613134/135079):

> A pytz timezone class does not represent a single offset from UTC, it represents a geographical area which,
> over the course of history, has probably gone through several different UTC offsets.
> The oldest offset for a given zone, representing the offset from before time zones were standardized
> (in the late 1800s, most places) is usually called "LMT" (Local Mean Time),
> and it is often offset from UTC by an odd number of minutes.

In other words, this is not the intended usage, `pytz.timezone` is incompatible with datetime's `tzinfo`.
Another quote, from `pytz`:

> Unfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime constructors
> "does not work" with pytz for many timezones.

Unfortunately, indeed.

And for the last mystery, when server runs with local timezone set to UTC:

```
>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1).astimezone(TIMEZONE).isoformat()
'2024-12-31T16:00:00-08:00'
```

The naive datetime inherits UTC timezone from the environment, so the result is shifted by 8 hours back.

The proper way of attaching timezone information to a naive datetime is using `pytz.localize`:

```
>>> pytz.timezone('US/Pacific').localize(datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1)).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-08:00'
```

And if you try following Python docs and use `dt.replace`, you'll see the same pytz incompatibility:

```
>>> datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1).replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone('US/Pacific')).isoformat()
'2025-01-01T00:00:00-07:53'
```
