# It's not cold in Russia

I see this misconception a lot.
People think, that it's cold in Russia and therefore people from Russia are cold resistant.
Some people are indeed more resistant to cold.
And some of them were born in Russia.
But it's mostly due to amount of body fat.

Now, why is it not cold in Russia?
Because "cold" is what you feel.
And, unlike with the heat, you can balance almost any cold with proper clothing.
I understand a person who was born and lived their whole life in Texas, might have never seen, or doesn't have skills for dressing properly for the cold winter.
But I can offer you this thought experiment, that should give you a good idea.

Imagine that you have nice modern thermal underwear - both pants and a long sleeve shirt.
On top of that you put pair of thick jeans and a warm flannel shirt.
On top of that you put snow bib overalls.
Then you wear a heavy winter coat that starts from your knees and has a big hood with long fur inside.
Under the hood you wear wool hat that covers your ears well.
Then you cover your mouth with a wool scarf.
Then you put nice warm winter gloves, like the once that make your iPhone inoperable.
Wait, before you put the gloves on, make sure you have socks, than thick wool socks on top, and high boots on high sole and wool inside.
If it's especially cold and windy outside, add skiing googles.

Now, look at yourself, there's no skin exposure, if you jsut stay like this indoors for 5 minutes, you're gonna be pretty sweatty.
Do you think you'll be cold outside?
Do you think you'd even know what is the temperature outside?
You won't, because there's no way you can tell how cold is the air.
Because you're completely insulated from it.

Now, there's another thing about Russians, that is much more true than cold resistance.
We love heat.
Many countries have no culture or appreciation of sauna, but virtually every Russian has been there more than once.
