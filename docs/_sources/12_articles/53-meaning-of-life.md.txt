# Meaning of Life

I had a pleasant conversation recently that started from the topic of religion.
We discussed how different cultures have different beliefs, but ultimately shared the same values in the same set of values exists in cultures that don't have religion at all.

The conclusion was that the differences in religion doesn't matter much.
Even though different countries have people live very different lives at the core it's all the same.

The values are simple of course.
Don't kill, don't steal, and so on.
They define how the society can leave and prosper together.
Now the thing is that this values are good for society as a whole they are not always the best mean for advantage of a single person.
And so we have laws, and police, and judges, and prisons, and punishment.
The institutions that are meant to bring fairness and justice to all the people in the society.
Of course, the concept of justice is an elusive one.
Without a single definition everyone agrees upon, that would apply to every situation.
Is it justice to kill a person who killed another person, or is it justice to lock them in a cell?
What's the society needs is to stop the bloodshed, so the family of a victim don't take revenge over there criminal, creating a family feud, that takes more lives over the years.
Having the offender in a cell, protects the society from them.
And protects the offender from the revenge.
In the absence of law, killing and stealing, is of course, the fastest way to achieve wealth.
So the religion serves, among many others, the purpose of explaining these simple mechanics of living in a society.

Now, why do we have injustice and unfairness?
Why do we have rich people who ruin the life of poor people?
And why is it so hard to achieve happyness and live a happy life?
