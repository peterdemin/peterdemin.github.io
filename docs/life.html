made be think how tech sector <em>remote-possible</em> in 2000s, <em>remote-friendly</em> in 2010s, then <em>remote-ubiquitous</em> in 2020s.
The rise of AI-based products for cheating in the remote interviews driven by the demand moves us into a new era of <em>remote-fraudulent</em> starting around 2025.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Apr</span> <span class="pre">27,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - I keep catching myself at the thought of inevitable decline.
Am I at my peak? Or am I past it? Is it only downhill ahead?
I think I can‚Äôt find a breaking point because there‚Äôs so many aspects to be considered.
Like cognitive decline, that starts at twenty one, but is balanced out by growing pattern matching library.
The shrinking breadth of opportunities, countered by accumulated wealth.</p>

They call it an ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù, and it has dedicated libraries, like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohappyeyeballs">aiohappyeyeballs</a> üëè</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">30,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - TIL about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl‚Äôs Law</a>.</p>
<p>The wikipedia article has this nice chart:</p>
<p><img alt="Amdahl's Law" src="_images/AmdahlsLaw.svg" /></p>
<p>Somewhat counter-intuitively, for the case when 90% (9/10th) of the task can be parallelized, splitting it into 10 workers, would not result in 10 times speed improvement.
It won‚Äôt even be 9 times.
The overall time of the task completion will only get faster by 5 times.</p>
<p>Wait, what?! We had this massively parallelizable task, 90%. Seems like the rest is peanuts.
We divide 90% of the task between 10 workers, it gets done 10 times faster, right?
Right, but, the remaining sequential 10% still take the same amount of time.
90% of original task time divided by 10 is 9%.
The new proportion of parallel work is only ~47%, less than a half.</p>
<p>To illustrate the time improvement in this example with an equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}T_{1} &amp;= 0.9 \times \frac{1}{1} + 0.1 \times 1 = 1\\T_{10} &amp;= 0.9 \times \frac{1}{10} + 0.1 \times 1 = 0.19 \approx \frac{1}{5}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>To put the units, it means that a task that a single worker completes in one hour, ten workers will do in 11 minutes and 24 seconds.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">15,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - In times when the life feels like too much, I remind myself of the words of my high school literature teacher.
When hearing complaints from the students about how big the home assignments are and how they don‚Äôt have enough time to prepare for all the subjects, she always said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll take rest in afterlife.‚Äù
For some students it sounded harsh, for other like a joke, but for all not much of an actionable advice.
It took me many years to understand that the idea is sound.
The life stops when you lay down in the coffin.
Until then, the purpose of life is to live it.
The more you do, the more capable you become of doing more.
On the other hand, the mind at rest weakens rapidly.
Humans adapt to good fast, and from the body‚Äôs perspective concerving energy is good.
Optimizing for minimum effort to get maximum pleasure.
Which is in contrast with a notion of productive life.
One has push themselves out of the comfort zone to achieve the greatness.
Taking rest is a step back rather then a mere pause.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">14,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - Reading <a class="reference external" href="https://zachgoldberg.com/ctohandbook/">CTO Handbook</a> made me realize, that if I had a great startup idea and the right people around me, I would do things that I‚Äôve never done before, many of which I deliberately chose not to do. I would also do a few nice things, but mostly the other kind.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">14,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> -
Some people, aspire for greater things, and manage to build their way to the goal.
Other people are happy with what they got, maybe incrementally improve situation over time, or stay in the same place and enjoy themselves.
And some people say: ‚ÄúOh, if I had this and that, I would achieve great things, build something amazing.‚Äù
Naturally, they never do, because that would put them in the first group.
I‚Äôd say this is some kind of a mental block, that doesn‚Äôt let them to join one of the other groups.
It makes them pathologically unhappy, leading them to put the blame on external forces, government, society, status, people, anything except for their own mindset.
People who are messed up in the head and capable of action belong in the nuthouse.
Messed up in the head but incapable of action - society burden.
This is not a person‚Äôs property, it only applies to some aspects and only within some timeframe.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">10,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - Added <a class="reference internal" href="12_articles/70-options-design.html"><span class="std std-doc">Configuration-Driven Development</span></a></p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">03,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - I think Sean Goedecke is onto something in his post ‚Äú<a class="reference external" href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/where-the-money-comes-from/">Knowing where your engineer salary comes from</a>‚Äù.
While the post is inline with his recurring cornerstone of a mature-pragmattic-staff-engineer, he touches on a topic of different lenses to look onto a software project.
Engineers focus on problem complexity (and solution simplicity), performance, architecture and whatnot.
The bridge to business people is effort estimate in man hours.
Which translates roughly to costs of implementation.
That business people use to weight against the projected profits over the lifetime of the project (in years).
Also, weighted against the potential return from other projects that team can do instead.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never seen profits enter the picture for engineering planning, os it‚Äôs often a kind of a dark area, of why is the deadline needs to be at this particular date.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">01,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - Added <a class="reference internal" href="17_notes/30-top_asked_meta_facebook_interview_questions_for_2025.html"><span class="std std-doc">Top Asked Meta (Facebook) Interview Questions for 2025</span></a></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mar</span> <span class="pre">01,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - Some questions should never be asked because they won‚Äôt be answered.
Not because the answer is unknown, but because it‚Äôs not in the person‚Äôs interest to provide an honest one.
This comes up a lot for opinion seeking.
Person‚Äôs opinion about the topic influences other people‚Äôs opinion about this person.
If a candidate is not super enthused about a company, they don‚Äôt get a job.
If project manager says that their project is not the best opportunity of a lifetime and super bomb that changes everything, they will be in trouble.
So you can‚Äôt ask them. Because their hands are tied. Their opinion belongs to their superiors, or public.
Even you ask someone, what do they think of you, you‚Äôre not going to get an honest opinion.
Because any negativity in the opinion may backfire in the future.
So, here we are, in a bright shiny world, where everyone is super happy about everyone else.
Except that half of marrieages end in divorce, people get laid of every year, and 90% of startups fail.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Feb</span> <span class="pre">14,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - TIL Talos Group of Cisco has 64 open-source repos on GitHub: https://github.com/Cisco-Talos.
Most prominent is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav">ClamAV</a> - the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_antivirus_software">only</a> open source anti-virus toolkit.
Of course it wasn‚Äôt originated inside of Cisco.
And it wasn‚Äôt even the first acquisition.
And Talos Group is kinda independent company under Cisco umbrella (based in Maryland, by the way).
But still, I find this to be a cool piece of trivia.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Feb</span> <span class="pre">13,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - Sad <a class="reference external" href="https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/">resignation letter</a> from Asahi Linux maintainer.
I‚Äôve never used or heard about Asahi Linux before.
Or never cared about running Linux on Apple hardware, since MacOS is close enough to Linux for my uses.
But the letter clicked with me of a few topics.</p>
<p>One is, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Is_Other_People">hell is other people</a>, including OSS.
I love open-source, and most of my hobby projects are public.
But not many of them see much external contribution.
The most joy I get is when I‚Äôm heads-down working on them, not when I try to align with strangers.</p>
<p>Another is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway‚Äôs Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[O]rganizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I see open-source as a great organizational structure to run software projects.
But it‚Äôs still prone to the problems, that any human community has.
I still wonder, though, can open-source projects governance be tweaked in ways, to solve it?..</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Feb</span> <span class="pre">13,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - This is gold:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance">Rational ignorance</a> is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the supposed cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the expected potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve done it to so many topics, and had hard time explaining why exactly even to myself.
Religion, politics, Android development, serverless, etc.
So many things where I see the low value without having putting 1% effort into study.
Of course, there are things that I ignore out of laziness and arrogance as well. But that‚Äôs off-topic.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Feb</span> <span class="pre">12,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - The topic that comes up from time to time is how frustrating the visa/greencard situation is.
People wait for years or decades for a process that‚Äôs purpose is to wait.
The system is run by people who are citizens and have no empathy to the people who are their customers.
In fact, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre considering their applicants as customers at all.
The system is a poorly masked adversarial filter.</p>
<p>Another adversarial filter I and many people in my social circle interact with a lot is technical interviews for software engineers.
I‚Äôm not gonna say anything new regarding how frustrating and annoying the common process is.
What‚Äôs interesting, though, is that being on the other side, interviewing other people, I get zero motivation to tweak the process to get feedback.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Jan</span> <span class="pre">13,</span> <span class="pre">2025</span></code> - One of the thoughts that I come back over and over again is how leetcode interviews are failing at letting good candidates pass.
Sometimes candidates are so anxious, that they can‚Äôt put a for loop together. Even after building complex systems for a decade.
Nothing new, I guess. The prerequisite for passing a leetcode interview is being comfortable with leetcode interviews.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>This book is written by an independent Russian journalist who worked at Novaja Gazeta for many years until it was banned.
Mostly, these are reportages from the great rural Russia, far from the big cities (the story from small villages on the high-speed train line between Moscow and St. Petersburg is one of the best).
I Love Russia helps us understand today‚Äôs deep Russia and the consequences of the fall of the USSR and the advent of Putin.
It is also a love letter to the homeland, hence the title, but it does not bend to the official narrative; quite the opposite.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I probably won‚Äôt read the book, but I will recommend it to people who want to learn more about the modern Russian history.</p>

It would be a bed that perfectly follows your body shape and provides equal support everywhere.
That makes sense to me.
You can go to a beach, lie in sand a wiggle a bit, until you shape up the sand around your body.
But there‚Äôre always many distractions, like sun, wind, noise, and insects, eww.
Or maybe the sensory deprivation tank, where you float in dense salty water in complete silence and darkness.
I‚Äôm not sure how would it work with turning around, or involuntary movements during the sleep.
Mark Rober made a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs">Liquid Sand Hot Tub video</a> where he explains the sensation of being submerged under sand, as a weighted blanket.
The sand is pretty irritating for a sleep, though.

Complex stands for inherent problem the software solves.
Complications come from solving the problem in a wrong way.
It could be using bad abstraction, over-engineering, inadequate team structure resulting in mixed component responsibilities.
Software is meant to solve the complexity of the real world problem, but it always introduces unnecessary complications for maintainers.
Complexity can‚Äôt reduced, as it is inherent to the problem at hand, while complications constitute technical debt, that can and should be addressed but rarely is.
The same thinking can be applied to life in general.
The inherent conflict of life is that it‚Äôs finite and energy consuming.
Besides that, most of the struggles we go through are artificial complications.
The worst examples of such struggles come up when complications take over complexity.
People get caught in the minutiae of everyday life, chasing synthetic goals, imposed by other people who have no interest in their wellbeing.
Governments create laws and procedures that are designed to prevent crime, but make everyones lifes harder.
Rich people find ways to suck money from poor.
Personal decisions must go through an approval of some external entity.
Social contracts prevent expression of internal desires.</p>

I liked the way they wirelessly cast screen using two-fingers swipe up in the direction of the cast target.
I also liked how they share message attachments.
The operating systems they are running seem to provide consistent experience across devices, so I assume there‚Äôs a tight integration.
What I liked most is that attachments contained two kinds formats.
One was a presentation layer, similar to a static HTML page.
Another was data (like JSON, or CSV) that can be direcly imported to a database or Jupyter Notebook.
Like one time a person sent a bunch of people profiles, and the other side reviewed them and imported to their contacts.
Another time it was asteroid coordinates, that were presented as an interactive 3D model, but also could be imported into the navigational system.</p>
<p>I wonder if we can build this today.
Each attachment would be an archive with HTML file that pulls raw data from a JSON file sitting by its side.
But also having a ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button that exposes the data file directly.
Or maybe a single HTML file with all the small data and assets embedded, and large assets pulled from S3.</p>

When there are two lanes and there‚Äôs a merge ahead from the right lane.
In the perfect world the merge is fair, the cars from the left and right lane alternate and both lanes go at the same speed.But what happens instead is some cars from the right lane merge early breaking the alternation order.
Then the car from behind in the right lane goes ahead and merges before the early merger.
And this breaks the pattern so that some cars from the right lane get into the left lane without a car between them.
The result is that the right lane goes faster.</p>

Which is true due to typing, obviously. But also for the toolset.
With Python, you gotta be disciplined to keep your third-party requirements in order. It‚Äôs not much work, but you also can get away without doing it. And if there‚Äôs no one to catch you in action, this might bite years later.
You hire smart people, who know their stuff, but don‚Äôt know Python (and are not really into learning the advanced topics of Python, because they are hired for the stuff they know well).
And they do whatever is easier to get things done.
And it‚Äôs not always the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The path of least resistance in Python is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>no type annotations</p></li>
<li><p>no linter</p></li>
<li><p>no autoformatter</p></li>
<li><p>no requirement files (and no version pinning)</p></li>
<li><p>no packaging</p></li>
<li><p>no meaningful module and class breakdown</p></li>
<li><p>no sensible docstrings or docs website.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm not saying this is how all the projects go.
But this is what you might get if you don‚Äôt put any experienced folks on the project.</p>
<p>Whereas with Golang, you have to get the most of the things right, or it won‚Äôt work at all.

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Psychology and Personal Development:</strong> In psychology, especially in the field of personality and identity studies, there‚Äôs an understanding that people often have core beliefs, values, and experiences that shape their identity and worldview.
This is sometimes explored in the context of life stories or narrative identity, where people construct their identities based on key life events and themes.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Studies:</strong> In literature, this concept is often discussed in terms of an author‚Äôs thematic preoccupations or motifs.
Some authors and artists are known for returning to the same themes, questions, or motifs throughout their work, which can be a reflection of their personal obsessions, experiences, or worldview.</p>

When you assemble an IKEA cabinet with two kinds of bolts, a long one and a slightly shorter one.
And it‚Äôs really hard to tell which one you have in hand unless you put them next to each other.
So, when you start assembling the cabinet, you put a shorter bolt in place and keep assembling until, at the last step, you are left with the longer bolt, and you realize that you actually need a shorter bolt which you used at the first step. Now, you have to disassemble the cabinet to switch the bolts.
It‚Äôs a simple mistake that is not obvious at the moment but comes up later when it‚Äôs harder to fix it.</p>

Classic arcade game setting with a top-down view and simple cartoonish graphics.</p>
<p><strong>First level.</strong>
You stand in line, and the line moves slowly (left to right on the screen).
Each person in front of you moves a split second after the person in front of them.
Your goal is to catch up as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Second level.</strong>
There are human hunters standing a few people after you, and they are shooting at you.
You must dodge their bullets, and when you dodge, the bullet kills a person in front of you.
When the person in front of you dies, you can take their spot, which speeds up your progressions through the line.</p>
<p><strong>Third level.</strong>
While standing in line, you also need to fill in a form.
This form includes some math quizzes.
While filling out the form, you keep dodging the bullets, making sure that bullets don‚Äôt hit the person who will be accepting your form who stands in front of you.</p>

It‚Äôs like with Ikea furniture, that seems bland and minimalistic. It doesn‚Äôt express any style or beauty, it‚Äôs functional and that‚Äôs it. Another example is people who focus their self expression in the way they look. Be it some special hair style, choice of clothes, or tattoos. Contrary to people who look bland, maybe simple. But express their selves in their thoughts. It feels like people who spend their time on their looks trade it for having something worthy in their heads. The parallel with the furniture is that you can make your prefab functional furniture truly yours and personal with DIY decoration, and you can spend good times wondering your mind, as opposed to going to hair stylist, or picking a tattoo that matches your personality.
I guess, what I‚Äôm trying to say is, your self expression is not for showing off someone else‚Äôs craft, it‚Äôs for you alone and small circle of people who matter to you.</p>

<div><p>They pay for it by having to invest a lot into release management, version synchronization across multiple teams, much more integration testing, worse understanding of the product by individual developers / teams, and, in general, lower quality of the product.

<div><p>Although I am a strong advocate of unit testing, I am not a fan of test-driven development. The problem with test-driven development is that it focuses attention on getting specific features working, rather than finding the best design. This is tactical programming pure and simple, with all of its disadvantages. Test-driven development is too incremental: at any point in time, it‚Äôs tempting to just hack in the next feature to make the next test pass. There‚Äôs no obvious time to do design, so it‚Äôs easy to end up with a mess.</p>

<p>A high criticism tolerance is learned by understanding that ones self worth is not attached to output or delivery.
(This is hard in our industry) It comes from self-acceptance and compassion.
And these values are learned early on.
You‚Äôll find that the people that break down at the slightest criticism the most are those that were criticised the most as children as well.
Those that had no room for being anything other than perfect.
Where value was obtained from performance.
To take it even further‚Ä¶why see it as criticism at all? You are not your lines of code.</p>
<p>As much as i like the concept in general in life, in this case its just ‚Äúyou are not your lines of code‚Äù.
Also people who criticize people make a mistake kind of.
Always criticize the code, not the person</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>(Sometimes anger is healthy, it may also be a signal to us that our boundaries have been violated.)
Exactly.
And if that boundaries get violated repeatedly in the same situation (especially by the same people), it is fine to release that anger in a controlled way.
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that some folks haven‚Äôt left the state where they sometimes need a (vocal) pat on their hand to realize they crossed boundaries they shouldn‚Äôt cross.
If you can play that game, congrats.
Also, do not swallow your anger.
Find a non-destructive, non-harmful way to release it.
As anger is a physical reaction, the easiest way is to go for a walk, ride your bike or whatever.
Whatever floats your boat should be fine.</p>

So far we got a landing page to collect emails of the people who will early access to the service once we launch it.
Building it is fun. I learned 11ty and tailwind, refreshed my CSS. The whole thing is deployed to Netlify and uses Netlify Forms and Functions to save the submitted emails. So far we are well into the free tier.
Many parts of the site are generated by, or with help, of ChatGPT and other AI services. Their output is grammatically correct, but dull and soulless, which doesn‚Äôt work well with marketing we‚Äôre looking for.
We gonna have a professional designer work on the page, and give us mock ups, that I should be able to quickly enact through the 11ty+tailwind boilerplate I built.</p>
<p>I started reading ‚ÄúStart small, stay small: a developer‚Äôs guide to launching a startup‚Äù by Rob Walling. The book is exciting and straight to the point. I already can see how much our effort is misplaced.</p>

<p>You look at your arms but all the lifting is done by your legs.
When you begin, it feels that the arms strength is the bottleneck, but the progress comes from learning to keep arms relaxed and controlling your balance to let the legs do the work.</p>
<p>The obvious way to progress seems to be from building up strength. But losing weight can actually boost your performance in shorter time.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you plateau, the best thing is to take a break. Muscles grow when they rest, and when you come back you suddenly have more endurance and can do harder routes.</p>
<p>One of the super powers of experienced climbers is to be very aware of getting tired, so they can find a good spot to rest on the wall.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.storj.io/">Storj</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nextcloud is a bit weird Snap installation with PHP, MariaDB, and Redis.
I don‚Äôt feel comfortable exposing self-managing PHP applications (read Wordpress-level security),
so I‚Äôve put it behind my 2FA cloud proxy. And of course it doesn‚Äôt work well with the Nexcloud mobile client.
Aside from security, performance on my old home server is not that great.
Image previews are generated on-demand, so it takes awhile to see my 300 GB photo gallery.
Apple live photos seem to have no support too. All in all, I don‚Äôt think it can replace Google Photos, as I hoped.</p></li>
<li><p>Storj is an implementation that I had another day. Pretty good one.
Set up could have been better streamlined, so it took few hours to hook up a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2 TB external HDD storage.
As a side effect I know have an Etherium wallet, that should be used for pay outs. We‚Äôll see.
Overall, I like their implementation a lot. From ideation to performance and security aspects.
I wish I could make it bare-metal, but I caved too early and went with the recommended Docker installation.</p></li>

I enjoyed KK‚Äôs article on <a class="reference external" href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/truth-vs-trust/">Truth vs Trust</a>.
It talks about a utopian news outlets that track down origins of every statement.
Not a fact check (that journalists are ‚Äúdoing‚Äù now), just a chain of who quoted who.
The article‚Äôs start point is that we can‚Äôt infer truth from a statement itself.
But we can track who said what and an origin of every statement.</p>
<p>The problem is though, that for polarizing topics (where truth can‚Äôt be established,
and we need to rely on trust) all modern news outlets would cover facts that are convenient for them,
and omit everything else.</p>
<p>Which means, that trustworthiness of a source is not a scalar, but more of a 3D matrix, that has topics, time, and past dishonesty as axes.</p>

<p>Oxidizing 10 kilos of human fat requires inhaling 29 kilos of oxygen to produce 28 kilos of carbon dioxide and 11 kilos of water.
It means that you lose roughly the same amount of fat as you sweat.</p>

Whether was great except for a short rain on the first day when we had to setup the camp. We built a short zip line from 3 truck straps, which was more fun during building than riding.</p>

<p>Stress management is management of body and mind. Stress is an integral part of human biology. Without stress hormones we would simple die.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Survival kit: sleep, eat, exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep: 7-9 hours a day. Consistent schedule for work days and weekend. Reduce screen time before sleep. Keep phone outside of bedroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Food: three colors of vegetables and fruits. 3 meals a day. Standard servings - no overeating.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise: stretch every now and then. Brisk walks for 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Don‚Äôt need to start doing everything at once. Build good habits one step at a time. Lifestyle change feels like a hard work.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid quick fixes: pills, drinks, energy bars, phone apps, gadgets, books, movies. Those only increase the number of things to keep track of. And the relief is only temporary.</p></li>
<li><p>Write down the goals, not just say it.</p></li>
<li><p>Note what causes stress, make a list of situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice simple meditation several times a day. Focus on breath and do a body scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Relax muscles while sitting, one group at a time. Neck, shoulders, arms, back, legs and feet.</p></li>
<li><p>Hang out with friends to feel social connection.</p></li>
