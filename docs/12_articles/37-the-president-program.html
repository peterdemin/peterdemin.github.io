<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>It’s 2024, I’m the new president of the United States. For the next four
years, my main areas of focus are just two:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Healthcare Reform: The medical insurance system is deeply broken. The
prices are too high, while the salaries of the healthcare workers are
incomparably small. The only party that benefits from healthcare
system is insurance. We must redo it from the ground up. Reducing
patient bills, eliminating middle-men, and improving the work-life
balance of healthcare workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Educational Reform: US education is in a bad state. The price for
getting a degree in a demanding field is above what a person can make
working in that field. At the same time teachers are under a great
stress, that causes record-high attrition. We must rebuild the
schools and universities to make high quality education an affordable
reality for each US citizen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I choose to intentionally ignore other topics, like Criminal Justice
Reform, Infrastructure Modernization, Social Equity and Inclusion,
Disaster Preparedness and Response. My step-by-step plan for improving
US Healthcare and Educational systems is as follows.</p>

<h3>III. Healthcare System Models<a class="headerlink" href="#iii-healthcare-system-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<section id="a-single-payer-systems">
<h4>A. Single-Payer Systems:<a class="headerlink" href="#a-single-payer-systems" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Single-payer healthcare systems are characterized by a government-funded and administered approach to healthcare.
In these systems, a single public entity collects funds through taxes or other means and directly pays for healthcare services on behalf of all citizens.
This model is often praised for its potential to achieve universal coverage, streamline administrative costs, and negotiate lower drug and treatment prices due to its collective bargaining power.
